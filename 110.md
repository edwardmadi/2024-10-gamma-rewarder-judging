# Any user can DOS claim for any other user due to Brevis processing limits

### Summary

The generation of a Brevis proof relies on on-chain data (storage slots, receipts, events) to prove a claim. In the case of the `GammaRewarder`, events are used (`deposit`, `withdraw`, `transfer`). However Brevis has some limits on how many events can be processed for a single proof

During public alpha the limit is `1500` as per [docs](https://docs.brevis.network/developer-resources/limits-and-performance#total-data-points):
> The maximum number of total receipts/storages/transactions you can process in one query in the publicly accessible version is limited to 1500. 

As a result, any user can deny claiming for any other by making a big amount of events (`Deposit` or `Transfer`) to a given address


### Root Cause

The root cause lies in using a single Brevis proof to prove claiming capability for a user during a distribution. A single proof may not be sufficient due to Brevis limits.

[BrevisApp.sol#L22-L26](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/BrevisApp.sol#L22-L26):
```solidity
    function brevisCallback(bytes32 _requestId, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) external {
        (bytes32 appCommitHash, bytes32 appVkHash) = IBrevisProof(brevisProof).getProofAppData(_requestId);
        require(appCommitHash == keccak256(_appCircuitOutput), "failed to open output commitment");
        handleProofResult(_requestId, appVkHash, _appCircuitOutput);
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Bob makes 1500 deposits for 1 wei to Alice address on a given hypervisor

### Impact

Any user may be denied rewards claiming

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The mitigation of such an attack vector is not trivial, a solution to consider would be adding capability for aggregating partial epoch processing.
