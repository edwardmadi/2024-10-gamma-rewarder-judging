# Unauthorized Reward Claim via `brevisCallback` Call

### Summary

The `brevisCallback` function is publicly accessible and allows any user to call it, which creates the potential for a malicious actor to attempt to forge `_requestId` and `_appCircuitOutput` values to meet validation requirements and claim rewards fraudulently. This could lead to unauthorized transfers of reward tokens to an attacker.

### Root Cause

The `brevisCallback` function can be called by any account, and there are no further access restrictions. This allows attackers to try manipulating inputs, particularly `_requestId` and `_appCircuitOutput`, to pass verification and bypass other restrictions in `handleProofResult`.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `brevisCallback` function relies on the hash validation of `_appCircuitOutput` against `appCommitHash` and checks `vkHashes[_vkHash]`.
- `handleProofResult` does not verify if the reward corresponds directly to the `distributionId`.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker is able to call the `brevisCallback` function directly, which allows them to craft values of `_requestId` and `_appCircuitOutput` and attempt to pass the verification process.

### Attack Path

- Step 1: The attacker crafts a `_requestId` and corresponding `_appCircuitOutput` that would pass the verification requirements within `brevisCallback`.
- Step 2: The attacker sends the crafted `_requestId` and `_appCircuitOutput` to `brevisCallback` to trigger `handleProofResult`.
- Step 3: If the verification steps within `brevisCallback` and `handleProofResult` pass, the attacker could succeed in triggering the transfer of rewards to their own address without legitimate proof.

### Impact

If successful, this attack allows the unauthorized transfer of rewards, leading to loss of funds from the contract. The lack of validation for the relationship between `distributionId` and the actual reward claim parameters can also open the door for repeated fraudulent claims.

### PoC

A proof of concept could involve using a forged `_requestId` and `_appCircuitOutput` designed to meet the conditions checked in `brevisCallback` and `handleProofResult`. By crafting these values and sending them to `brevisCallback`, an attacker might exploit the contract to transfer rewards.

### Mitigation

1. Add restrictions on callers;
2. Limit the reward groups that callers can obtain to prevent callers from constructing values ​​to receive all rewards of the contract.
