# in `Lib.sol` Lack of Validation on Transaction Type Format Will Cause Invalid Transaction Decoding for Users

### Summary

The missing validation on the format of the transaction type will cause incorrect or invalid transaction decoding for users as an attacker could craft a malicious transaction that bypasses the `txType` check and leads to unintended contract behavior.

### Root Cause

In the following section of the contract, there is no proper validation of the transaction format or the `txType` beyond the simple equality check for `DynamicFeeTxType`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L81C1-L83C1
There is no validation of whether the structure of the transaction follows the expected RLP format for DynamicFeeTxType.

### Internal pre-conditions

A malicious user sends a transaction where `txRaw[0]` is set to 2, but the rest of the transaction is not correctly formatted according to the expected `DynamicFeeTxType` specification.


### External pre-conditions

The Optimism network processes the malicious transaction as valid since the contract does not thoroughly validate the transaction structure.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a malicious transaction with `txType == 2` but with an incorrect RLP structure for the remaining fields.
2. The attacker submits this transaction to the contract.
3. The contractâ€™s `decodeTx` function passes the txType == 2 check without validating the format of the RLP data.
4. The contract attempts to decode the malformed transaction, leading to incorrect decoding or potential reversion.

### Impact

Users: Suffer from transaction failures as the contract may revert when it encounters a malformed transaction or decode it incorrectly.
Protocol: Suffers from potential exploitation, as an attacker could bypass certain transaction format checks, leading to unpredictable behavior or denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement proper validation of the entire transaction structure, not just the `txType`.
Ensure that the RLP encoding and fields match the expected format for `DynamicFeeTxType` transactions.
