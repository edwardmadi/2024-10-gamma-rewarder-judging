# `blocksPerEpoch` can be set to any value which is against intended design i.e 6 hours - 1 day blocks duration

### Summary

`blocksPerEpoch` can be set to any value which is against intended design i.e 6 hours - 1 day blocks duration

### Root Cause

Missing upper bound check while setting blocksPerEpoch via `setBlocksPerEpoch()`

### Internal pre-conditions

Admin can set any desired value of `blocksPerEpoch` via `setBlocksPerEpoch()`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1) Admin calls `setBlocksPerEpoch()` function to set the blocksPerEpoch.
2) `blocksPerEpoch` is expected to be `6 hours - 1 day worth of blocks` as per intended protocol design as per contest readme but due to missing upper bound check while setting the `blocksPerEpoch`.
3) This missing check allows the admin to set the `blocksPerEpoch` to any desired value.
4) This breaks the intended design of protocol.

### Impact

Due to high `blocksPerEpoch`, zk proof computation would be too expensive per user. The intended design is to keep it as `6 hours - 1 day worth of blocks ` as per contest readme, however this is not implemented in `setBlocksPerEpoch()` function so this breaks the intended design of protocol.

### PoC

As per contest readme- 

> blocksPerEpoch will not be set as something excessively large so as to make the zk proof computation too expensive per user. 6 hours - 1 day worth of blocks would be reasonable. This would be computed in blocks however.

### Mitigation

Consider having upper bound check for `blocksPerEpoch ` in `setBlocksPerEpoch()` function such that it should not exceed the intended design i.e `6 hours - 1 day worth of blocks` duration.
