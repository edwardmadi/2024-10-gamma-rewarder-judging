# Missing `from` address verification in RLP decoding function allows potential transaction origin mismatch

### Summary

The `decodeTx` function in the `Tx` library parses a raw transaction and recovers the from address using the transaction signature `(v, r, s)`. However, it does not check if this recovered `from` address matches the one provided in the RLP data, allowing for a potential mismatch. This can lead to unintended issues where the from address may be misinterpreted due to an accidental or incorrect value in the RLP data.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability stems from the absence of a validation step to ensure that the `from` address obtained from the transaction `signature` matches the `from` address specified in the `RLP` data. Without this check, the transaction origin can appear incorrectly, either due to user error or unintended discrepancies or malicious actions.

### Attack Path

1. A user prepares a transaction with a specific `from` address in the RLP data, intending it to represent the sender.
2. However, if the signature's `from` address differs (due to an error or incorrect signing), the function will decode and present the from address derived from the signature, not `from` the RLP data.
3. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect transaction interpretation or origin confusion, where the transaction's origin may appear inaccurately.

### Impact

Mismatched `from` addresses may lead to unclear or inaccurate records of transaction origin.

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure the `from` address derived from the signature matches the address in the RLP data:

```solidity
require(info.from == values[8].toAddress(), "Mismatch between RLP 'from' and recovered 'from'");
```
