# The attacker will break `Distribution parameters must remain immutable once set` invariant

### Summary

According to the README, key invariant from the `GammaRewarder` contract code:
 - Distribution parameters (hypervisor, token, amounts) must remain immutable once set.

According to the Sherlock docs: 
 - Issues that break the invariants from the above question, irrespective of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity.
 
A collision for a specific `distributionId` could change the `DistributionParameters` for the incentivizor, as an attacker might invoke the `GammaRewarder:createDistribution` function with a chosen `msg.sender` and `senderNonce` to achieve a collision.

### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108) there is a missing verification to check if the `distributionId` already exists.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Incentivizor starts a new reward distribution, and the `newDistribution` is added to the `distributions` mapping by distributionId.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker invokes the `createDistribution` function from an address with a nonce to create a collision for the specific `distributionId`

### Impact

The attacker can choose their own `DistributionParameters`, which disrupts the claiming functionality, preventing users from claiming their rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In the `createDistribution` function, consider verifying whether the `distributionId` already exists.
