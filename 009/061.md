# Insufficient Management of Token Decimals for Calculating Protocol Fees

### Summary

the protocol said that usdt is used and the use of a fixed BASE_9 constant for protocol fee calculations will cause transaction reverts for tokens with non-18 decimals, such as USDT, as the contract assumes all tokens have 18 decimals. This impacts users intending to create reward distributions with tokens like USDT, leading to failed transactions and disrupted reward mechanisms.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder.sol`, the protocol fee is based on a fixed `BASE_9` value (1e9), which assumes that all reward tokens adhere to the standard 18 decimal places. However, tokens like USDT use 6 decimals, causing the fee calculation to misinterpret the token's actual decimal structure and potentially revert transactions.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizer needs to call createDistribution() to set distributionAmountPerEpoch based on _amount with BASE_9 assuming 18 
decimals.
2. Reward token used must have exactly 6 decimals USDT.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Incentivizer invokes createDistribution() using the USDT reward token.
2. During fee calculation, the contract multiplies _amount by protocolFee and divides by BASE_9, assuming 18 decimals, which leads to incorrect fee computation.
3. The miscalculation causes the transaction to revert due to insufficient allowances or incorrect distribution amounts.

### Impact

Users trying to create reward distributions using USDT will encounter transaction failures, preventing them from utilizing the protocol's features with this token and resulting in loss of functionality. 
incorrect fee calculation that takes 100x more fees than intended. For example, what should be a 1% fee becomes a 100% fee, potentially draining all user funds.

### Mitigation

Retrieve the token's decimals using the decimals function from ERC20.
