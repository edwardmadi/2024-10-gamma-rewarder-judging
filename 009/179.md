# Incorrect Fee Calculations Due to Lack of USDC Decimal Normalization

### Summary

The absence of normalization for USDC (which has 6 decimals) when calculating fees in [gammaRewarder.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125) can lead to incorrect fee calculations. This discrepancy can result in the following issues:
1. Incorrect fee calculations could lead to transactions failing or users unintentionally losing funds due to miscalculations
2. Users may experience unexpected results or behavior when interacting with the contract.

```solidity
uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
```


### Root Cause

In `gammaRewarder.sol:125`, the lack of decimal normalization for USDC in the fee calculation leads to incorrect fee calculation.

```solidity
uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
```

### Impact

The lack of decimal normalization for USDC in the fee calculation leads to broken logic in the contract, resulting in incorrect fee assessments. This flaw can cause users to inadvertently underpay or overpay fees, potentially leading to failed transactions or unintended loss of funds.

### PoC

1. Current Implementation: The fee calculation in the contract uses the following line:
   
```solidity  
    uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
```
       Here, _amount is expected to be in the standard 18-decimal format.
    
2. Scenario:
        ◦ If an incentivisor wants to specify a fee using USDC, they may input an amount of 1000 USDC.
        ◦ Internally, this amount is represented as 1,000,000 (due to 6 decimals).
        ◦ Without normalization, the calculation will treat this as 1,000,000 in an 18-decimal context, leading to incorrect fee results.
  
3. Example Calculation Failure:
        ◦ If protocolFee is set to represent 1% (i.e., 10**7 for BASE_9), the calculation would yield:
         
```solidity
          Copy code
          fee = (1,000,000 * 10**7) / BASE_9;  // Incorrect if not normalized
```
 ◦ The expected behavior would be to treat 1000 USDC as 1000 * 10**12 (converted to 18 decimals), resulting in a different fee calculation

### Mitigation

1. Implement Decimal Normalization:

 ◦ Modify the contract to normalize the _amount before performing calculations. Specifically, for USDC:
 
```solidity
       uint256 normalizedAmount;
       if (_rewardToken == USDC_ADDRESS) {
           normalizedAmount = _amount * (10**12);  // Convert from 6 to 18 decimals
       } else {
           normalizedAmount = _amount;  // Assume standard 18-decimal format
       }
```
2. Update Fee Calculation Logic:
       
◦ Ensure that all fee calculations use the normalized amount:
       
```solidity
      
       uint256 fee = normalizedAmount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
```
