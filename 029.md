# If no users are eligible for rewards for a given distribution, rewards are unrecoverable

### Summary

There are no failsafes to recover the reward tokens that a distributor locks in when creating a distribution. As a result, if during some or all epochs of the distribution, no users are eligible to claim, the rewards for part of the distribution end up permanently locked.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder`, no recovery endpoint have been implemented for rewards. As we can see some amount of tokens is supposed to be distributed at each epoch of the duration of the distribution:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L127](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L127):
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Gamma Vault has no stakers during a full epoch of a reward distribution

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Some or all of the rewards for a distribution are permanently locked in `GammaRewarder`, with no possibility to recycle them to another distribution or recover them.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement either a recovery method (after a window period) or a possibility to redistribute rewards left on a distribution to another distribution (after a window period)
