# Anyone will call the createDistribution function in Gammarewarder contract and drain tokens.

###Severity
MEDIUM

### Summary

The createDistribution function in theGammaRewarder contract lacks an access control mechanism, allowing any address to call it. This could lead to unauthorized distribution entries, token drainage, and manipulation of distribution data, thereby affecting the protocol’s functionality and consuming funds intended for incentivized distributions.



### Root Cause

The createDistribution function is missing an access control check to verify that the caller is an authorized incentivizer. Without this check, any address can call createDistribution, enabling unauthorized users to interact with this function.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.The contract must have the protocolFeeRecipient and MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS configured correctly to allow createDistribution to be called.
2.The reward token must be whitelisted in the contract to pass the whitelist check (isWhitelistedRewardToken).

### External pre-conditions

1.An attacker must be able to call createDistribution without any restriction, meaning there is no onlyIncentivizer modifier or access control.
2.The attacker needs to approve sufficient tokens for _rewardToken (the whitelisted reward token) in order to exploit fee transfers.

### Attack Path

The attacker identifies that createDistribution lacks access control checks.They approve a whitelisted token and invoke createDistribution multiple times with minimal distribution parameters.This results in repeated fee charges, storage bloating with unauthorized distributions, and potential manipulation of distribution data that compromises the integrity of the protocol.

### Impact[Medium]

Token Drain: The protocol fee is collected from each distribution; repeated unauthorized calls can drain the token balance of the incentivizer or the protocol.

### PoC

Assume the attacker’s address is 0xAttacker.

0xAttacker approves a small amount of _rewardToken to the contract.

The attacker calls createDistribution with minimal distribution parameters as follows:

```solidity
rewardDistribution.createDistribution(
    0x1234...Hypervisor,  // Dummy address
    address(_rewardToken), // Whitelisted token
    1,                     // Minimal amount
    block.number + 1,      // Start block
    block.number + 2       // End block
);
```

This action deducts the protocol fee, adds an entry to distributionList, and allows 0xAttacker to call createDistribution repeatedly, draining approved funds and cluttering distribution data.



### Mitigation

Add an access control check to ensure only authorized incentivizers can call createDistribution. Use OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl library as shown:

Define an INCENTIVIZER_ROLE:
```solidity
bytes32 public constant INCENTIVIZER_ROLE = keccak256("INCENTIVIZER_ROLE");
```
Add a onlyIncentivizer modifier to createDistribution:
```solidity
modifier onlyIncentivizer() {
    require(hasRole(INCENTIVIZER_ROLE, msg.sender), "Caller is not an incentivizer");
    _;
}
```
Apply onlyIncentivizer to the function:
```solidity
function createDistribution(...) external nonReentrant onlyIncentivizer {
    ...
}
```
