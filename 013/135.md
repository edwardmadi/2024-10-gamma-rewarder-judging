# Unrestricted Contract Calls to `createDistribution` Allow Denial of Service and State Manipulation.

### Summary

The lack of restrictions on contract callers in the `createDistribution` function will cause potential denial of service and state inconsistencies for the `GammaRewarder` contract, as malicious contracts will interact in unexpected ways, leading to resource exhaustion and disruption of normal operations for legitimate incentivizers.

A malicious contract could use loops to continuously call functions within GammaRewarder. In this scenario, a malicious incentivizer might intentionally spend their funds in an attempt to disrupt or overload the GammaRewarder contractâ€™s operations.

### Root Cause

In the GammaRewarder contract's `createDistribution` function, there is no check to prevent contracts from calling it. This absence allows malicious contracts(Incentivisers) to interact with the function, potentially exploiting complex interactions, causing resource exhaustion, and introducing state inconsistencies.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Function Accessibility: The `createDistribution` function is publicly accessible and can be called by any address, including contracts.
2. No Caller Verification: There is no verification to distinguish between Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) and contracts when calling createDistribution.

### External pre-conditions

Deployment of Malicious Contract: An attacker deploys a malicious contract designed to interact with the GammaRewarder contract in complex or harmful ways.

### Attack Path

1. Malicious Contract Interaction: The attacker deploys a contract with complex logic capable of recursive calls or triggering callbacks. This malicious contract calls the `createDistribution` function repeatedly or in a way that consumes excessive resources.

2. Resource Exhaustion: By repeatedly calling `createDistribution`, the malicious contract fills up storage with unnecessary distributions. This leads to increased gas consumption and potential storage overflow.

3. Denial of Service: Legitimate users are unable to interact with the contract effectively due to resource exhaustion. The contract's functions may revert or fail due to reaching gas limits or corrupted state.

### Impact

1. Service Disruption for Legitimate Incentivizers: Legitimate incentivizers cannot create new distributions or interact with the contract due to resource constraints. Users may face higher gas fees or failed transactions when attempting to use the contract.

2. State Inconsistency in GammaRewarder Contract: The contract may enter unintended states, leading to malfunction or incorrect reward distributions. Potential loss of funds or incorrect allocation of rewards due to manipulated state variables.

3. Potential Loss of Trust: Users may lose confidence in the system's reliability and security, affecting the overall reputation of the protocol.

### PoC

Malicious incentivizer look like
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "./GammaRewarder.sol";

contract MaliciousIncentivizer {
    GammaRewarder public gammaRewarder;

    constructor(address _gammaRewarder) {
        gammaRewarder = GammaRewarder(_gammaRewarder);
    }

    function attack(
        address _hypervisor,
        address _rewardToken,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint64 _startBlockNum,
        uint64 _endBlockNum,
        uint256 _iterations
    ) external {
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < _iterations; i++) {
            gammaRewarder.createDistribution(
                _hypervisor,
                _rewardToken,
                _amount,
                _startBlockNum,
                _endBlockNum
            );
        }
    }
}

```
### Mitigation

1. **Restrict Function Calls to EOAs**

Implement a check at [GammaRewarder.sol:117](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L117) to ensure only EOAs can call `createDistribution`:

```solidity
require(msg.sender == tx.origin, "Contracts are not allowed to call this function");
```
Effect: This restriction prevents contracts from calling `createDistribution`, reducing the risk of complex malicious interactions.
It ensures that only direct user interactions are allowed, mitigating potential reentrancy and recursion attacks.

Considerations: Be aware that this restriction may prevent legitimate contracts, such as smart wallets (e.g: Gnosis Safe) or proxy contracts, from interacting with the function. Evaluate whether the security benefits outweigh the inconvenience to users who rely on such contracts.

Balance Security and Usability: Consider implementing alternative safeguards if restricting contracts is too limiting for legitimate use cases. For example, maintain a whitelist of trusted contracts allowed to interact with `createDistribution`.



2. **Limit Distribution Creation Rate**

Implement measures to prevent abuse through excessive calls:

```solidity
....

mapping(address => uint256) public lastDistributionTime;
uint256 public constant MIN_INTERVAL = 3_600; // Example 1 hr interval

function createDistribution(...parameters...) external nonReentrant {
    require(
        block.timestamp - lastDistributionTime[msg.sender] >= MIN_INTERVAL,
        "You must wait before creating another distribution"
    );

    lastDistributionTime[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;

    // function logic
}

....
```
Effect: 
1. Throttling: Limits how frequently a single address can create distributions. Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion due to rapid, repeated calls.

2. Deterrence Through Fees: Optionally introduce a fee for creating a distribution to discourage abusive behavior.
Fees can be burned or allocated to a fund for rewarding honest users.

Considerations: 
1. Set Appropriate Intervals: Choose a minimum interval that balances preventing abuse and not overly restricting legitimate users. Ensure the interval is reasonable for the expected usage patterns.
2. Monitor and Adjust: Continuously monitor contract usage to adjust intervals or fees as necessary. Be prepared to respond to evolving attack vectors.
