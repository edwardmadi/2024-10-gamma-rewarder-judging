# In `BrevisApp.sol` Ignoring Validation Results Will Enable Exploits Against BrevisApp Users"

### Summary

In the `BrevisApp` contract, the `validateRequest` function calls the` validateRequest` function from the `IBrevisProof` interface to validate a request. However, the return value of this function is not checked, and even if the request validation fails, the `validateRequest` function in `BrevisApp` will still return `true`. This could lead to scenarios where invalid or malicious requests are considered valid, which might result in unauthorized or incorrect operations in the contract.

### Root Cause

In BrevisApp.sol:11, the unchecked return value in the validateRequest function allows potential failures to go unnoticed.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract must be deployed with a valid instance of IBrevisProof.
The `_requestId` must be valid and correspond to an existing request in the brevisProof contract.

### External pre-conditions

The brevisProof contract must be functioning correctly and able to validate requests.
The IBrevisProof implementation must correctly return a boolean indicating the success or failure of the validation.

### Attack Path

1. An attacker can call the `brevisCallback()` function with a `_requestId` that has not been validated.
2. If `validateRequest()` fails silently due to the unchecked return value, the attacker can proceed with a malicious output in _appCircuitOutput.
3. This can result in the `handleProofResult()` being called with potentially invalid data, leading to erroneous state changes or other unintended behavior.

### Impact

The users suffer an approximate loss of trust in the system as invalid requests can be processed without any error handling. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability, potentially resulting in financial loss or unintended state modifications.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement checks to handle the return value of validateRequest(). Ensure that the calling function responds appropriately if the validation fails, preventing the callback logic from being executed with invalid data.
