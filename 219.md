### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L80
The EIP-1559 transaction includes an access_list at index 8 in the RLP-encoded list. Your code skips over this field and does not handle it properly.
The method for reconstructing the unsigned transaction (unsignedTxRaw) is complex and error-prone. It incorrectly adjusts the RLP length prefixes after removing v, r, and s.
The code computes the transaction hash using keccak256(unsignedTxRaw) without including the transaction type byte (0x02) as required by EIP-1559.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This omission leads to incorrect parsing of subsequent fields (v, r, s), as the indices used are off by one.
This leads to an incorrect transaction hash being computed, which in turn results in the wrong sender address being recovered.
The computed hash does not match the one used during signing, leading to a failed recovery of the senderâ€™s address.
