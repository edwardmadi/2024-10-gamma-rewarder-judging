# Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attack through Excessive Small Distribution Creation

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108
The createDistribution method allows users to create a reward distribution schedule. Without restrictions, an attacker could abuse this feature to create a large number of small reward distributions that consume the contract's storage resources, ultimately leading to a denial of service (DoS) attack. The contract's storage resources could be filled up, and the contract could even become unusable due to storage restrictions, or a large number of distributionIds could cause confusion.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108
The root cause of this problem is that the GammaRewarder contract does not set a minimum limit on the number of distributions created by users, but only judges that it is greater than zero, but malicious users can still create it with a small amount of funds. This allows malicious users to create a large number of small and meaningless distributions through the createDistribution function, thereby consuming storage resources and affecting the selection of distributionId.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract does not impose a limit on the number of distributions a user can create or the minimum amount of a distribution.
The distributionList array in the contract can grow indefinitely.
The contract does not check the upper limit on the number of distributions a single user can create.

### External pre-conditions

The attacker has sufficient gas to submit numerous transactions calling the createDistribution function.
The contract is accessible to any user, meaning anyone can invoke the createDistribution function to create new distribution plans.

### Attack Path

The attacker creates a small distribution each time by calling the createDistribution function multiple times.
Since the contract does not limit the number of distributions or the amount of distributions, the attacker can fill the distributionList with a large number of small distributions.
As the distributionList grows, the gas costs required to query and process the list will increase significantly.
Ultimately, the storage limit makes the contract inefficient, and the large number of distributions makes it difficult for users to use or even fail to work properly, causing a denial of service (DoS) attack.

### Impact

This causes some function calls to cost significantly more, or even fail due to gas limits.
distributionList consumes a lot of distributionList storage space
If not controlled, the contract may become unusable, preventing legitimate users from creating or claiming distribution rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Set a minimum distribution amount: Enforce a minimum reward amount for each distribution, preventing the creation of small or meaningless distributions.
