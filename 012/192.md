# [M-02] No minimum amount enforced in `GammaRewarder.createDistribution` can result in attacker exhausting distribution blocks and DOS-ing legitimate distributions

## Summary

Attacker can cause congestion in network and delay the creation of legitimate distributions with fair amounts

## Vulnerability Details

In `GammaRewarder.createDistribution`, no minimum amount is enforced when creating a distribution. Attacker can potentially create enormous amount of distrbutions and congest network. This can result in legitimate `createDistribution` transactions submitted with fair amount to be be delayed in being processed.

Additionally, an attacker can utilize multicalls to submit a large number of `createDistribution` transactions using multiple accounts, leading to futher network congestion and delaying legitimate distributions.

Multiple proofs will also have to be handled off chain for hypervisor to claim a very small amount.

## Impact

Potential DOS of legitimate `createDistribution` transactions with fair amounts
