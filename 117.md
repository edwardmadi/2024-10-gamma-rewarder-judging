# H-1 Duplicating Distribution ID to Block Claims, Locking Contract Funds Permanently


## Description

### `abi.encodePacked()` should not be used with dynamic types when passing the result to a hash function such as `keccak256()`
Use `abi.encode()` instead which will pad items to 32 bytes, which will [prevent hash collisions](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode) (e.g. `abi.encodePacked(0x123,0x456)` => `0x123456` => `abi.encodePacked(0x1,0x23456)`, but `abi.encode(0x123,0x456)` => `0x0...1230...456`). "Unless there is a compelling reason, `abi.encode` should be preferred". If there is only one argument to `abi.encodePacked()` it can often be cast to `bytes()` or `bytes32()` [instead](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/30912/how-to-compare-strings-in-solidity#answer-82739).
If all arguments are strings and or bytes, `bytes.concat()` should be used instead

now after this lets understand the flow of this contract with the function

1. Alice creates a distribution with huge deposits from their end
2. now as this is public due to the mappings of distributions and nonces we can find the address and nonce for the distribution
3. now an attacker gets to know this,tries to replicate it by making multiple distributions
4. after the distributionId is made same now the attacker is the msg.sender in the struct for DistributionParameters, so If Alice now tries to claim now,she won't be able to do it
5. the Attacker has griefed Alice with no way of getting the money out of this contract


### Conclusion
This process exemplifies how attackers can exploit distribution ID duplication to prevent legitimate users from reclaiming their funds, highlighting the need for robust validation measures.


## Impact

This makes it such that the original person wont be able to claim their own money and no way of it to be retrieved anyway
