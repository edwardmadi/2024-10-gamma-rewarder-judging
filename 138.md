# Protocol Fee can be set up to get most of the createDistribution amount

### Summary

The variable `protocolFee` determines the fees that are collected by the protocol
for the total amount of a distribution. This variable can be set to a maximum of
`1e9-1` by the owner, thus allowing the owner to steal almost all of the amount of a 
newly created distribution. [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L247)

NOTE: Even though this is a permissioned variable, if the owner account gets 
hacked, this will allow the hacker to steal almost all of the tokens of all the new
distributions that get created.

### Impact

This variable can be set to a maximum of `1e9-1` by the owner, thus allowing the owner to steal almost all of the amount of a new created distribution. 

### PoC

Take a look at the following:
```solidity
function test_protocolFee() public {
    uint256 amount = 100_000e6;
    uint256 protocolFee = 1e9 - 1;

    uint256 fee = amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
    console.log(fee, amount);
}

```
```foundry
[PASS] test_protocolFee() (gas: 3309)
Logs:

  Traces:

            │   └─ ← [Stop] 
                └─ ← [Return] 
```


### Mitigation

Restrict `protocolFee` to a maximum reasonable amount for a fee. EX: 1e8 == 10%.
```solidity
    /// @notice Sets the protocol fee rate
    /// @param _protocolFee New fee rate (in BASE_9 units)
    function setProtocolFee(uint256 _protocolFee) external onlyOwner {
        require(_protocolFee <= 1e8, "Protocol fee is based on 10**9");
        protocolFee = _protocolFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(_protocolFee);
    }
```
