# Lack of Validation for `blocksPerEpoch` in `setBlocksPerEpoch`

### Description
The function `setBlocksPerEpoch` allows the admin to set `blocksPerEpoch` to any value, including extremely high or low values. If `blocksPerEpoch` is set incorrectly, it can interfere with the calculations in `createDistribution` and other functions dependent on block-based reward intervals. An excessively high or low value could disrupt reward calculations and prevent distributions from functioning as expected.

### Recommendation
Add a validation check to ensure that `blocksPerEpoch` remains within a reasonable range:
```solidity
require(_blocksPerEpoch > 0 && _blocksPerEpoch <= MAX_BLOCKS_PER_EPOCH, "Invalid blocks per epoch");
```
This validation would prevent blocksPerEpoch from being set to values that could disrupt distribution logic.
