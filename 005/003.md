# handleProofResult doesn't check if the owner toggled the whitelist, allowing blacklisted token distribution

### Summary

The lack of a whitelist check in `handleProofResult` will cause an unauthorized token distribution for users as the **owner** will toggle the whitelist to include blacklisted or malicious tokens and distribute them without validation during the reward claim process.

### Root Cause

The lack of a whitelist check on `rewardTokenAddress` is the root cause. This omission allows tokens that may have been blacklisted after distribution creation to be distributed during the reward claim process without verification.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Owner** needs to call `toggleTokenWhitelist()` to set `isWhitelistedRewardToken[_rewardToken]` to be `0` (blacklisted) after the distribution has been created.
2. **User** needs to call `createDistribution()` to set `realAmountToDistribute` using the reward token that was initially whitelisted.
3. **Owner** needs to call `toggleTokenWhitelist()` to toggle the reward token status from whitelisted to blacklisted before the `handleProofResult` function is invoked.
4. **handleProofResult** needs to execute without checking if `rewardTokenAddress` is still whitelisted (i.e., `isWhitelistedRewardToken[rewardTokenAddress]` remains unchecked).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **User** calls `createDistribution()` using a whitelisted reward token, setting up a valid distribution.
2. **Owner** calls `toggleTokenWhitelist()` to blacklist the previously whitelisted reward token after the distribution has been created.
3. **User** submits a proof for rewards by calling the function that triggers `handleProofResult()`, expecting to claim the rewards from the distribution.
4. **handleProofResult()** executes without checking whether the reward token is still whitelisted, allowing the claim to proceed with the blacklisted token.

### Impact

The **users** suffer an approximate loss of trust and potential financial loss as they may unknowingly receive blacklisted or malicious tokens during reward claims.

### Mitigation

```solidity
require(isWhitelistedRewardToken[rewardTokenAddress] == 1, "Reward token is no longer whitelisted.");
```
