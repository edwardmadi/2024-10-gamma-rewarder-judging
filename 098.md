### Summary

The contract contains a vulnerability in the handling of the `protocolFee` parameter that can lead to unintended high fees being applied during the calculation of user fees. This could result in significant financial loss for users if the `protocolFee` is set incorrectly by the owner.

### Vulnerability Detail
The `setProtocolFee` function allows the contract owner to set the small `protocolFee` which can cause a draining large amounts from users:

1. The `BASE_9` constant represents a scaling factor of 10**9.
2. If the owner sets a small `protocolFee` (e.g., 2), it will be used as `uint256 fee = _amount * 2 / 10**9`, leading to an extremely high fee being subtracted from user amounts.
 3. This means the owner could set a small `protocolFee`, inadvertently draining large amounts from users.
 ### Impact
 
 The current implementation of the `protocolFee` setter poses a significant risk to users due to the potential for unintended high fees. 
 
 ### Tool used

Manual Review
 
### Recommendations

To mitigate the identified vulnerability, the following adjustments are recommended for the `setProtocolFee` function:
1. Clarify Fee Setting:
- Modify the `setProtocolFee` function to enforce clear bounds on the `protocolFee` parameter. Add a check to ensure the fee is above a minimum threshold, as follows:

 ```solidity
require(_protocolFee < BASE_9, "Protocol fee is based on 10**9");
require(_protocolFee > BASE_7, "Protocol fee must be greater than 10**7 (1%)");
```

2. Define Minimum Fee:

- Setting a minimum fee (e.g., BASE_7, which corresponds to 1%) helps ensure that the protocol fee is always at least 1%, preventing the owner from setting excessively low fees that could harm users.

 3.  Implementing clear boundaries:
 
 - on the `protocolFee`, including both upper and lower limits, will enhance the security of the contract and protect user interests.
