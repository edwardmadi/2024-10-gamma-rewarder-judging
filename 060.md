# An attacker can cause incorrect signature verification

### Summary

The improper handling of RLP length prefixes in the `decodeTx` function will cause incorrect signature verification for users, as an attacker will craft transactions that exploit RLP encoding boundaries to manipulate the reconstructed unsigned transaction data.


### Root Cause

In `decodeTx`, specifically in the reconstruction of `unsignedTxRaw`, the function incorrectly assumes a fixed subtraction of 67 bytes for the signature components (`r`, `s`, `v`). It does not correctly adjust RLP length prefixes when the length crosses critical thresholds. This flawed assumption can be exploited to miscalculate the RLP length, leading to incorrect message hashing and signature recovery.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The transaction data length is at a boundary where removing 67 bytes changes the RLP length prefix category (e.g., from a length requiring a multi-byte prefix to one requiring a single-byte prefix).
2. The `decodeTx` function processes a transaction with a carefully crafted data length that exploits the length prefix miscalculation.


### External pre-conditions

An attacker can submit transactions with specially crafted data lengths to the contract.


### Attack Path

1. The attacker crafts a transaction whose RLP-encoded length is just above a length prefix boundary (e.g., 56 bytes).
2. Upon removing the signature bytes (67 bytes), the length falls below the boundary (e.g., down to 55 bytes), requiring a change in the RLP length prefix.
3. The `decodeTx` function fails to adjust the RLP length prefix appropriately when reconstructing `unsignedTxRaw`.
4. An incorrect message hash is generated and used in `ecrecover`, causing the contract to recover an incorrect `from` address.
5. The attacker exploits this to impersonate other users or disrupt contract operations.


### Impact

The users suffer from incorrect transaction attribution, potentially allowing attackers to impersonate them or execute unauthorized actions within the contract. This compromises the integrity of transactions and can lead to security breaches and loss of trust in the system.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Adjust the `decodeTx` function to:

- Dynamically calculate the lengths of the signature components (`v`, `r`, `s`) instead of assuming a fixed length.
- Correctly adjust the RLP length prefixes when reconstructing `unsignedTxRaw` after removing the signature components.
- Use a reliable RLP encoding/decoding library that handles length prefixes accurately and manages edge cases effectively.
- Implement validation checks to ensure the reconstructed unsigned transaction data is correctly formatted before proceeding with signature recovery.
