# ERC20 rewards can be stuck forever if no user stack during distribution period

### Summary

If no user stack during distribution period, or if user do not claim their rewards afterwards, funds can be stuck forever in the contract.

### Root Cause

No way to retrieve ERC20 after distribution period has ended.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizer call `createDistribution()` to create a new reward distribution, [ERC20 are sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L130) to `GammaRewarder.sol`


### External pre-conditions

1. Hypervizor badly communicates of incentivized plan for the associated Gamma Vault 
2. No user stack in the Gamma Vault, thus no one to claim the rewards
3. Time elapse and `distribution.endBlockNumber > block.number`
4. [Users are unable to claim](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L203) because the distribution range has passed. If user stack now, it's too late. Because no one staked during the distribution range, now no one can claim the distribution with proof that will pass `handleProofResult()`
5. ERC20 are stuck forevere in the contract, as there is no way to retrieved the funds 


### Attack Path

Not an attack. Funds can be stuck forever if no user stack during the distribution period.

### Impact

Fund stuck forever in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### PoC

See external pre-conditions

### Mitigation

Add a way for `incentivizer` to retrieve `rewardAmount` left after the distribution period has ended. Add a grace period for user to claim their rewards before `incentivizer` can retrieve the blocked funds.
