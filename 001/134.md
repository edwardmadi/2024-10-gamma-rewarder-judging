# Invariant not met, not all funds will be used for distribution

### Summary

One of the protocol’s key invariants is:
> Total distributed rewards must match initial deposit minus protocol fees

This invariant is not maintained due to precision loss in calculations.

Sherlock rules:
> What properties/invariants should be upheld even if breaking them has low or unknown impact?
> Issues that break the above invariants, regardless of whether the impact is low/unknown, will be assigned Medium severity. High severity applies only if the issue falls into the High severity category per the judging guidelines.

### Root Cause

When the `incentivizor` creates a distribution, it provides an amount and time interval expressed in blocks. The protocol fee is then deducted from the amount, and the remaining value is intended for distribution, which is calculated based on `amountPerEpoch`. To minimize calculation error, the interval must be exactly divisible by the epoch duration, as checked in line `120`. Next, the `amountPerEpoch` value is calculated in line `127`, where there’s no guarantee that `realAmountToDistribute` will be evenly divisible by the number of epochs.

As a result, the entire submitted amount may not be used in distribution.

  119:         require(_amount > 0, "Distribution Amount has to be greater than zero.");
  120: >>>     require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch");
  121:         require(isWhitelistedRewardToken[_rewardToken] == 1, "Reward token has to be whitelisted.");
  122:         require(IERC20(_rewardToken).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount, "Incentivisor did not approve enough tokens to Reward contract.");
  123:         require(protocolFeeRecipient != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
  124: 
  125:         uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
  126:         uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
  127: >>>     uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
  128:

  130:         IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);

### Impact

- The README invariant is broken.
- Any remaining tokens from division remain stuck in the contract — there’s no function to withdraw the surplus or a mechanism to return the excess.

### Proof of Concept

- `realAmountToDistribute` may not divide evenly by the number of epochs calculated from `((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch)`.
- `realAmountToDistribute != amountPerEpoch x ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch)`

```solidity
File: GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol
  125:         uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
  126:         uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
  127: >>>     uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
  128: 
  129:         IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
  130: >>> IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);
```

### Mitigation

After calculating `amountPerEpoch`, multiply this by the number of epochs to determine the exact required amount. Use this calculated amount instead of `realAmountToDistribute` for collection from `msg.sender`.
