# Incorrect claimed amount if blocksPerEpoch is modified between distribution and claiming

### Summary

Incorrect claimed amount if blocksPerEpoch is modified between distribution and claiming

### Root Cause

```blocksPerEpoch``` is used to calculate the amount to distribute/claim in each epoch, given the total amount to distribute and start and end blocks. The issue comes because this value could be changed between the distribution and claiming by the owner if necessary (otherwise it would be an immutable variable set in the contract's constructor) through the function ```setBlocksPerEpoch()```.

This could cause claimers not being able to claim tokens, leading to a DoS when trying to claim. This problem becomes real if you realise that there could even be different distributions with different values of ```blocksPerEpoch```.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A distribution is made with following params: _amount = 100000, _startBlockNum = 100000, _endBlockNum = 200000. When this is done, ```blocksPerEpoch``` is equal to 20000 (approximate number of validated blocks in 12 hours). This means 5 epochs, with a amount per epoch of 100000 / 5 = 20000 tokens.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Owner changes ```blocksPerEpoch``` to 18000, which is in range of what indicated in the docs (6 hours - 1 day)
2. User tries to claim for the whole period with ```brevisCallback()```, which calls ```handleProofResult()```. The following require line will revert: ```require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");``` as ```(200000 - 100000) % 18000``` is not 0.
3. User will not be able to claim until owner sets back ```blocksPerEpoch``` to a value that fits the mentioned require.

### Impact

Users will be prevented from claiming rewards in case that ```blocksPerEpoch``` is modified after distribution and the period they try to claim for is not whole number of epochs. This is likely to be a problem for such a long time as owner cannot modify ```blocksPerEpoch``` to satisfy each user.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

When a distribution is created, store the value of current ```blocksPerEpoch``` and recover it from there when claiming tokens. DistributionParams struct must contain this new param:

```solidity
struct DistributionParameters {
    // ID of the distribution (populated once created)
    bytes32 distributionId;
    // Address of the Gamma Hypervisor that needs to be incentivized
    address hypervisor;
    // Address of the token of distribution
    address rewardToken;
    // The distribution amount per epoch
    uint256 distributionAmountPerEpoch;
    // Block number at where the distribution should start
    uint64 startBlockNumber;
    // Block number at where the distribution should end
    uint64 endBlockNumber;
    // Wallet address of incentivizor who creates this distribution
    address incentivizor;
+ uint64 currBlocksPerEpoch;
}

 DistributionParameters memory newDistribution = DistributionParameters({
            distributionId: distributionId,
            hypervisor: _hypervisor,
            rewardToken: _rewardToken,
            distributionAmountPerEpoch: amountPerEpoch,
            startBlockNumber: _startBlockNum,
            endBlockNumber: _endBlockNum,
            incentivizor: msg.sender,

        });

+       require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % params.currBlocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
        require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
        require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
        require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");
