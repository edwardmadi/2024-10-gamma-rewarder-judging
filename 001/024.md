# Enhanced block validation lead to erroneous state changes in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

This report highlights a vulnerability related to block validation in a smart contract function. The lack of comprehensive checks on the validity of block parameters can lead to erroneous state changes and potentially exploitative behaviors, affecting the integrity of the smart contract's reward distribution mechanism.

### Root Cause

The function `handleProofResult` includes a check for block validation:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203
```solidity
require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```
While the function verifies that `startBlock` is less than `endBlock` and checks that the difference between the blocks is a multiple of `blocksPerEpoch`, it does not account for the current block number, which can lead to two primary issues:
1. Claiming Rewards Before Distribution Start: Users may attempt to claim rewards before the distribution has started, which is not adequately blocked.
2. Claiming After Distribution Ends: There are no checks to prevent users from claiming rewards after the distribution has ended.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users may claim rewards for blocks that are not included in the defined distribution range.

The contract could lose funds as rewards are improperly distributed to users who should not be eligible.

This vulnerability poses a moderate risk, as it could lead to unauthorized claims and financial loss, but it requires specific conditions to be exploited effectively.

### PoC

1. Assume a distribution is active from block `100` to block `200`.
An attacker crafts a proof output claiming rewards from block `50` to block `150`, bypassing the start of the distribution.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Enhanced Block Validation Vulnerability Test", function () {
    let RewardContract;
    let rewardContractInstance;
    let attacker;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
        const RewardContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("RewardContract");
        rewardContractInstance = await RewardContractFactory.deploy();
        await rewardContractInstance.deployed();

        // Assume initial distribution setup here
        await rewardContractInstance.createDistribution(
            hypervisorAddress,
            rewardTokenAddress,
            1000,
            100,  // startBlock
            200   // endBlock
        );
    });

    it("should allow an attacker to claim rewards before the distribution starts", async function () {
        // Attacker crafts a proof output that claims rewards from block 50 to 150
        const appCircuitOutput = ...; // The malicious output to be passed

        await expect(rewardContractInstance.handleProofResult(..., appCircuitOutput)).to.changeTokenBalance(rewardToken, attacker, expectedReward);
    });

    it("should allow an attacker to claim rewards after the distribution ends", async function () {
        // Assume current block is 201
        await network.provider.send("hardhat_setNextBlock", [201]);

        // Attacker crafts a proof output that claims rewards from block 180 to 210
        const appCircuitOutput = ...; // The malicious output to be passed

        await expect(rewardContractInstance.handleProofResult(..., appCircuitOutput)).to.changeTokenBalance(rewardToken, attacker, expectedReward);
    });
});
```
When running this test, the output will indicate that the attack was successful, demonstrating that the attacker was able to claim rewards outside of the valid distribution period.

### Mitigation

Implement checks to ensure that the `startBlock` is greater than or equal to the current block number and that `endBlock` is less than or equal to the current block number when a claim is made.
```solidity
require(startBlock >= block.number, "Claiming before distribution starts is not allowed");
require(endBlock <= block.number, "Claiming after distribution ends is not allowed");
```
