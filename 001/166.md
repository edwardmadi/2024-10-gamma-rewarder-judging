# Updating blockPerEpoch with setBlocksPerEpoch() may deny rewards to user

**Description:**
In the protocol we have a strict requirement that endBlockNumber - startBlockNumber should be a multiples of blockPerEpoch when claiming rewards. With that said let's look at the following scenario:

1. Incetivizor puts rewards for distribution for startBlock=100, endBlock=200, as blocksPerEpoch is set to 20 the subtraction is multiples of that number and the distribution is created.
2. Owner updates the blocksPerEpoch variable to 21
3. Users try to claim their rewards for the whole duration startBlock=100, endBlock=200 but she is unable to due to the new blocksPerEpoch as 100 is not a multiple of 21

**Mitigation:**
Keep current blocksPerEpoch in the DistributionParams and check with it.
