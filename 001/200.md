# Loss of Precision in createDistribution() Due to Division Rounding in Epoch Calculation

### Summary

The `createDistribution()` function in `GammaRewarder.sol` has a rounding issue in calculating [amountPerEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L127) due to integer division in Solidity. This can lead to distributions with less than the expected amount per epoch or even zero, impacting reward accuracy and fairness.

### Root Cause

The calculation:
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
```
performs integer division, resulting in a loss of precision, especially when `realAmountToDistribute` or the divisor is small. Solidity does not support fractional values, so any division that produces a non-integer result will be rounded down.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `realAmountToDistribute` represents the distribution amount after deducting fees.
2. The value `_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum` is divisible by `blocksPerEpoch`.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user initiates a distribution with small values for `realAmountToDistribute` or `blocksPerEpoch`.
2. Solidity’s integer division truncates any fractional part.

### Attack Path

1. **Loss Due to Integer Division**:
   - Suppose `realAmountToDistribute` is 54, `_startBlockNum` is 12,000,000, `_endBlockNum` is 13,172,800, and `blocksPerEpoch` is 21,600 (equivalent to 6 hours).
   - The divisor in the equation is:
     \[
     (\text{_endBlockNum} - \text{_startBlockNum}) / \text{blocksPerEpoch} = (13,172,800 - 12,000,000) / 21,600 = 54
     \]
   - Plugging into the equation:
     \[
     \text{amountPerEpoch} = 54 / 54 = 0.99454297407
     \]
   - Since Solidity rounds down, this becomes:
     ```solidity
     amountPerEpoch = 0;
     ```
   - **Result**: `amountPerEpoch` is zero, leading to a zero allocation per epoch, causing the distribution to fail or deliver no rewards.

2. **Further Example with Minimal Values**:
   - Assume a smaller `realAmountToDistribute` such as 10 and a similar epoch breakdown where the divisor is greater than `realAmountToDistribute`.
   - Here, `amountPerEpoch` would also resolve to zero, again failing to deliver any rewards.


### Impact

1. **Zero Reward Distribution**: With zero `amountPerEpoch`, users receive no rewards in each epoch, defeating the purpose of the distribution.
2. **Reduced Incentives**: Users may be discouraged if the actual rewards per epoch are significantly lower than expected due to truncation.
3. **Protocol Fairness**: The protocol’s reward distribution becomes unreliable and inconsistent, impacting user trust.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Use Multiplied Scaling to Preserve Precision**:
   - Multiply `realAmountToDistribute` by `blocksPerEpoch` to maintain precision, applying the calculation as follows:
     ```solidity
     uint256 amountPerEpoch = (realAmountToDistribute * blocksPerEpoch) / (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum);
     ```
2. **Minimum Epoch Check**:
   - Ensure that `amountPerEpoch` is greater than zero, halting the function if zero or very low values would prevent meaningful distribution.
