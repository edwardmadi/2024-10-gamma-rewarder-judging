# Possible precision loss due to insufficient check on input value.

### Summary


A precision loss vulnerability has been identified in the fee calculation mechanism of the Distribution contract. The issue occurs in the **createDistribution** function where large token amounts or little token amounts can lead to significant precision loss during fee calculations.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L119

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125

In `GammaRewarder.sol:119` we only check that _amount is more than 0. So if the user inputs a value less than BASE_9, The protocol could not charge fees.
As well if the user inputs a large enough value solidity will round down to lowest value. 




### Internal pre-conditions

1. The protocol only check that the **_amount** parameter in **createDistribution** function is more than 0.
2. the fee calculation does not use a fixed point math library.

### Mitigation

I would suggest the use of variables such as a maximum deposit value and a minimum deposit value. 
Then on `GammaRewarder:125` I would suggest the use of a fixed point math library  like`PRBMath` for example in order to mitigate the possibility of rounding issues.
