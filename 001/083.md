# Total distributed rewards does not match initial deposit minus protocol fees

### Summary

Total distributed rewards does not match initial deposit minus protocol fees. 

This is one of the key invariants mentioned in the README : 

>Key invariants from the contract code:
Total distributed rewards must match initial deposit minus protocol fees
Users cannot claim more rewards than allocated per distribution period
Same rewards cannot be claimed twice (enforced by claim tracking)
Distribution parameters (hypervisor, token, amounts) must remain immutable once set

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125-L127

This issue arises because of rounding down in the `amountPerEpoch` calculation. If `realAmountToDistribute` isn't divisible by the number of Epochs, there will be `1` wei less token distributed per Epoch

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Consider the following example :  

`Number of Epochs` : 19
`initial deposit` : 200
`protocol fees` : 2
`realAmountToDistribute` : 198
`amountPerEpoch`: 198/19 = 10
`Total distributed rewards` : 10*19 = 190
`Loss` : 200 - 190 - 2 = 8

As you can see, `Total distributed rewards` does not match `initial deposit minus protocol fees` and 8 wei is stuck in the contract forever

### Impact

Breaks key invariant and causes a loss of funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make this change : 
```diff
        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
+       uint256 amountToTransfer = ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch) * amountPerEpoch

        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
-       IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);
+       IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToTransfer);
```
