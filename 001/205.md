# Inconsistent `blocksPerEpoch` Check in `GammaRewarder.sol` Causes Claim Verification Failures

### Summary

In `GammaRewarder.sol`, [blocksPerEpoch]() is used to validate both distribution creation in [createDistribution()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L120) and claim verification in [handleProofResult()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202). If `blocksPerEpoch` is updated between these two calls, valid claims may fail the check in `handleProofResult()` even though they were initially valid. This discrepancy results in valid claims being incorrectly rejected.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this bug is that `blocksPerEpoch` is mutable and shared across `createDistribution()` and `handleProofResult()`. When `blocksPerEpoch` changes between these function calls, claims that aligned with the previous `blocksPerEpoch` may no longer meet the validation in `handleProofResult()`.

```solidity
require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch"); // createDistribution
```
```solidity
require((endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid"); // handleProofResult
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A distribution is created with a specific `blocksPerEpoch` value, and the distribution length aligns with this value.
2. The protocol owner changes `blocksPerEpoch` after distribution creation but before claim verification.

### External pre-conditions

1. A user submits a claim for a distribution that was valid under the old `blocksPerEpoch` value.
2. The new `blocksPerEpoch` value misaligns the claimâ€™s block range, causing it to fail verification in `handleProofResult()`.

### Attack Path

1. **Initial Distribution Creation**:
   - `blocksPerEpoch` is initially set to 6 hours (e.g., `21,600` blocks).
   - A user creates a distribution with `_startBlockNum = 12,000,000` and `_endBlockNum = 13,172,800`.
   - The duration:
     \[
     \text{Distribution Duration} = 13,172,800 - 12,000,000 = 1,172,800
     \]
   - With `blocksPerEpoch = 21,600`, this is valid:
     \[
     1,172,800 \, \% \, 21,600 = 0
     \]
   
2. **Modification of `blocksPerEpoch`**:
   - Before any claims are made, the owner changes `blocksPerEpoch` to 8 hours (e.g., `28,800` blocks).
   - This change would impact all subsequent claims.

3. **Claim Submission**:
   - A user submits a claim for a portion of the distribution using a claim block range, e.g., `startBlock = 12,200,000` and `endBlock = 12,300,000`, aligning with the original `21,600` `blocksPerEpoch`.
   - However, under the new `blocksPerEpoch = 28,800`, this range is invalid:
     \[
     (12,300,000 - 12,200,000) \, \% \, 28,800 \neq 0
     \]
   - This leads to the claim failing verification due to misalignment.

### Impact

1. **Claim Verification Failure**: Users cannot claim valid rewards as intended, which impacts trust and user experience.
2. **Protocol Fairness**: The changeability of `blocksPerEpoch` without retroactive applicability creates inconsistency, potentially leading to claims being arbitrarily approved or rejected based on timing.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Store `blocksPerEpoch` in Distribution Metadata**:
   - Store the `blocksPerEpoch` value in the `DistributionParameters` structure during distribution creation:
     ```solidity
     uint64 blocksPerEpoch;
     ```
   - Update the checks in `handleProofResult()` to use the stored value instead of the global `blocksPerEpoch`.

2. **Fixed Validation Logic**:
   - Ensure that the validation in `handleProofResult()` always uses the initial `blocksPerEpoch` set during `createDistribution()`, eliminating the impact of subsequent changes.
