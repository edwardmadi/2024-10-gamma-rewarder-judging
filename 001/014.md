# Precision Loss in `GammaRewarder.sol::createDistribution` leading to Zero Fee

**Description:** 
In the `GammaRewarder.sol::createDistribution function`, fees are calculated based on the `protocol fee` defined in the contract. According to the documentation and code, the protocolFee must not exceed the constant value `uint constant BASE_9 = 1e9;`.
```javascript 
  function setProtocolFee(uint256 _protocolFee) external onlyOwner {
        require(_protocolFee < BASE_9, "Protocol fee is based on 10**9");
       // Code
}
```

When calculating the fee within `GammaRewarder.sol::createDistribution`, the fee to be sent to the `fee_recipient` is computed as follows:


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125
```javascript
uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;

```

However, this fee calculation can lead to issues due to Solidityâ€™s integer truncation. If the result of `_amount * protocolFee` is not perfectly divisible by` BASE_9`, the decimal portion will be discarded, which may inadvertently result in the fee being rounded down to zero(Prove in POC).


**Impact:** 
1. Fee rounded down to `zero` due to precision loss.
2. Miscalculation of fee, Loss of fee (which is in decimal point/after decimal)


**Proof of Concept:**

Scenerio 1 : Where the fee can be 0

1. Incentivizer calls the  `GammaRewarder.sol::createDistribution` function with parameters 
   (uint256 _amount ) neglecting other params for clear & precise understanding
2. The fee gets calculated `uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9`
- _amount = 9e2 
- protocolFee =  2e5
- BASE_9 =  1e9

`uint256 fee = 9e2 * 2e5 / 1e9;`

Here, the fee will be `0.18 resulting in 0` because of truncation nature of solidity
thus, `rounding down the fee to 0`   

Scenerio 2: Where the fee is rounded down 


1. Incentivizer calls the  `GammaRewarder.sol::createDistribution` function with parameters 
   (uint256 _amount ) neglecting other params for clear & precise understanding
2. The fee gets calculated `uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9`
- _amount = 53e2
- protocolFee =  2e6 
- BASE_9 =  1e9

`uint256 fee = 9e2 * 2e6 / 1e9;`

Here, the fee will be `10.18 resulting in 10` because of truncation nature of solidity
thus, `rounding down the fee to 10`, where the fee should be rounded up to 11.   

**Recommended Mitigation:** 
-  Introduce a min fee requirement check.
                         OR
- Use a roundup mechanism when calculating fee
