# The Missing Balance Check in `GammaRewarder.sol` Will Cause a Loss of Rewards for Users as Attackers Will Drain the Contract

### Summary

The missing balance check in the reward distribution process of `GammaRewarder.sol` will cause a complete loss of rewards for users as attackers can drain the contractâ€™s reward tokens by front-running legitimate reward claims. This can result in users not receiving their rightful rewards even after their claims have been marked as "claimed."

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder.sol`, there is a missing balance check before the reward tokens are transferred:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187C1-L219C1
```solidity
IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).safeTransfer(userAddress, totalRewardAmount);
```
The contract does not verify whether it holds sufficient balance to execute the reward transfer, which opens it up to exploitation.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The attacker detects that a user will attempt to claim rewards and submits their own transaction to front-run the legitimate claim.
2. The contract processes the attacker's claim first, sending the reward tokens without verifying its balance.
3. The attacker's transaction drains the contract, leaving no tokens for legitimate users.
4. When legitimate users attempt to claim, their transactions will be processed, but they will not receive any tokens due to insufficient contract balance. The event logs will falsely indicate successful claims.

### Impact

Users suffer a complete loss of rewards as they cannot claim their rightful amounts.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the check 
```solidity 
require(IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) >= totalRewardAmount, "Insufficient contract balance");
```
This will prevent the contract from attempting to transfer more tokens than it holds, ensuring that users will not lose rewards due to insufficient balances.
