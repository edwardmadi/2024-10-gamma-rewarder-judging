# Rounding issue can result in fees rounding down to 0

### Summary

in the GammaRewarder.sol contract, the function `createDistribution` takes an amount of tokens and distributes them over a certain time-window. However, there is a problem with how the fees are calculated :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108C4-L128C1
 ```solidity

  ->     uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);
```
The protocol's fees are calculated as:  uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
This does not account for cases where the fee amount will not be an integer. For example, in cases where the _amount equals 99, 999, 90 etc. the fee (let's say 1% in this case) will be a non-integer.

In such cases, solidity does the fee calculation like this:  `99 * 10^7 / 10^9 = 0.99` . Since Solidity only handles integer division, this results in 0, meaning no fee is collected. 


### Impact

This issue causes the protocol to not collect the intended amount of fees from certain values of _amount, leading to revenue loss.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, it's important to ensure the fee calculation properly handles rounding.
