# Rounding error leading to dust accumulation in amountPerEpoch calculation

### Summary

In the distribution mechanism of the `GammaRewarder.sol` contract, the `amountPerEpoch` calculation rounds down due to integer division, leaving a small remainder (or "dust") in the contract after each epoch. Given that the distribution period can span up to a maximum of `9,676,800` blocks, this small dust accumulation per epoch can lead to a significant total remainder, reducing the overall distribution efficiency.

### Root Cause

In the `createDistribution()` function, `amountPerEpoch` is computed by dividing `realAmountToDistribute` by the total number of epochs, and Solidity rounds down any remainder in integer division. This creates a small dust amount left after each epoch, which stays in the contract:

```solidity
        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);
```

With a maximum distribution period of `9,676,800` blocks, a substantial number of epochs may occur, leading to significant cumulative dust by the end of the period. For example, with even a minor dust remainder, the aggregate remainder across thousands of epochs can result in a notable fraction of `realAmountToDistribute` left undistributed.

```solidity
    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks
```

Including dust in the final epoch prevents cumulative rounding loss, ensuring the entire `realAmountToDistribute` is allocated by the end of the distribution period.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

A portion of `realAmountToDistribute` remains in the contract after the distribution period ends, reducing the intended allocation to participants.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include dust in the final epoch. E.g.

```solidity
uint256 numEpochs = (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch;
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / numEpochs;
uint256 totalDistributed = amountPerEpoch * numEpochs;
uint256 remainder = realAmountToDistribute - totalDistributed;

// During the distribution, add `remainder` to the final epoch.
```
