# Rounding and Zero Fee Bypass Vulnerability in GammaRewarder.sol#createDistribution

### Summary

The [createDistribution()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125) function in GammaRewarder.sol contains rounding issues and allows zero-fee distributions in particular cases.

    The fee calculation (fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9) always rounds down. But ALWAYS the rounding SHOULD be in FAVOR of the protocol. (example calculation of rounding down: 1999 * 30,000,000 / 1e9 = 59.97 (more details below in the report)).
    If _amount * protocolFee is less than BASE_9, no fees are transferred, which can allow users to bypass fee payments entirely for very small distributions and repeat this many times as they want (distribute many times and every time with small amount). Also the users aren't obstructed from gas fees, because the gas fees on Optimism are very very small. Imagine to distribute 45 stEth without the transferring of any fee (the user just should to pay for the gas fees). (small example -> 45 * 20,000,000 / 1e9 = 0.9. (amount = 45, protocolFee = 20% = 20,000,000)) Also, consumers are not deterred by gas fees because Optimism's gas fees are [very very small](https://www.cryptoneur.xyz/en/gas-fees-calculator). Imagine distributing 45 stEth without passing on any fee (the user just has to pay the gas fees which on Optimism are very small). (small example -> 45 * 20,000,000 / 1e9 = 0.9. (amount = 45, protocolFee = 20% = 20,000,000))

    [GammaRewarder.sol#createDistribution()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L102C1-L147C6) function:

  ```solidity
  /// @notice Incentivizor creates a new reward distribution
    /// @param _hypervisor Address of the hypervisor to incentivize
    /// @param _rewardToken Address of the reward token
    /// @param _amount Total amount of tokens to distribute
    /// @param _startBlockNum Starting block number for distribution
    /// @param _endBlockNum Ending block number for distribution
    function createDistribution(
        address _hypervisor, 
        address _rewardToken, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        uint64 _startBlockNum, 
        uint64 _endBlockNum
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // ... other code ...

        // 1. @audit -> Fees are rounded down. Always the rounding should be in favor of the protocol.
        // 2. @audit -> Users can create distributions whithot transfer any fees. (zero fees for the protocol)
        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        // ... other code ...
    }
    ```

### Root Cause

1.   Rounding Down in Fee Calculation:
        The fee calculation uses integer division, which rounds down any fractional result, resulting in a slightly lower fee than intended.

2.    Bypass of Fee Payment for Small Amounts:
        When _amount * protocolFee is less than BASE_9, the integer division result is zero, allowing users to create distributions without transferring any fees. (Precision Loss)

### Attack Path

1. **Underpayment Due to Rounding Down**:
   - Assume `_amount = 1999` tokens and `protocolFee = 30,000,000` (3%).
   - The expected fee calculation without rounding would yield:
     \[
     \text{Expected Fee} = 1999 \times \frac{30,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 59.97 \text{ tokens}
     \]
   - However, in Solidity, integer division truncates decimals, giving:
     ```solidity
     fee = 1999 * 30_000_000 / 1_000_000_000 = 59 tokens;
     ```
   - **Result**: The protocol loses a fractional amount of `0.97 tokens` in this transaction.

2. **Zero-Fee Distribution with Small `_amount` Values**:
   - Assume a small `_amount` of `45` tokens and `protocolFee = 20,000,000` (2%).
   - The expected fee calculation would yield:
     \[
     \text{Expected Fee} = 45 \times \frac{20,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 0.9 \text{ tokens}
     \]
   - Since Solidity rounds down, the fee becomes:
     ```solidity
     fee = 45 * 20_000_000 / 1_000_000_000 = 0 tokens;
     ```
   - **Result**: The protocol collects no fee for this transaction, allowing users to bypass fees on distributions by submitting low `_amount` values.

3. **Effect of High `protocolFee` with Small `_amount`**:
   - Letâ€™s consider a scenario with a very high `protocolFee` (50% or `500,000,000`) and a moderate `_amount` of `200`.
   - The expected fee calculation is:
     \[
     \text{Expected Fee} = 200 \times \frac{500,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 100 \text{ tokens}
     \]
   - However, in the event that `_amount` is further reduced (e.g., `_amount = 1`), the calculated fee rounds down to zero:
     \[
     \text{Expected Fee} = 1 \times \frac{500,000,000}{1,000,000,000} = 0.5 \Rightarrow \text{Rounded Fee} = 0 \text{ tokens}
     \]
   - **Result**: This inconsistency further opens the protocol to losses due to zero-fee transactions for low `_amount` values.
   - 

### Impact

1.    Users can avoid fee payments in certain conditions, resulting in potential revenue losses for the protocol.
2.    Rounding down causes all fees to be marginally lower than intended, leading to an accumulation of uncollected fees over time. Also, ALWAYS the rounding SHOULD be in FAVOR of the protocol.
3.    The protocol consistently loses revenue due to rounding down in the fee calculation. Even small deviations can accumulate significantly over time.


### PoC

### Mitigation



    Ceiling Adjustment for Fee Calculation:
        Implement a ceiling calculation for fees, ensuring they round up:

```solidity
uint256 fee = (_amount * protocolFee + BASE_9 - 1) / BASE_9;
```

        This ensures fees are calculated in favor of the protocol.

    Minimum Fee Requirement:
        Set a minimum _amount threshold in createDistribution() to ensure all transactions incur a fee:

```solidity
require(fee > 0, "Insufficient amount for protocol fee OR Fee too low for distribution");
```
