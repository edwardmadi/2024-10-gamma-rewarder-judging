# Changing epoch block number will deny existing distributions claiming or potentially change reward amounts

### Summary

At any time, the `GammaRewarder` contract owner can change the `blocksPerEpoch`, which determines the duration of an epoch. Unfortunately, since the claiming of rewards relies on this variable, some rewards may end up unclaimable.

The simplest example of this occurs if a distribution lasts exactly one epoch (`blocksPerEpoch` blocks), and the value of `blocksPerEpoch` is increased.

It is then impossible to satisfy all the conditions:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203):
```solidity
    require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
    require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```

### Root Cause

Claiming is based on the global `blocksPerEpoch` variable, when it should be stored into the `distributions` mapping, so that the value when that particular distribution was created is used.


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Existing distributions are pending when admin calls `setBlocksPerEpoch` 


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A distributor calls `createDistribution` with a `_endBlockNum`,`_startBlockNum`, such that `_endBlockNum-_startBlockNum == blocksPerEpoch`
2. Admin increases `blocksPerEpoch` by calling `setBlockPerEpoch`

> As a result all of the rewards for the distribution are lost

### Impact

Up to all of the rewards for a distribution can be unclaimable

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


Add a field for `blocksPerEpoch` to `Distribution` struct:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L12-L27](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L12-L27):
```diff
struct DistributionParameters {
    // ID of the distribution (populated once created)
    bytes32 distributionId;
    // Address of the Gamma Hypervisor that needs to be incentivized
    address hypervisor;
    // Address of the token of distribution
    address rewardToken;
    // The distribution amount per epoch
    uint256 distributionAmountPerEpoch;
    // Block number at where the distribution should start
    uint64 startBlockNumber;
    // Block number at where the distribution should end
    uint64 endBlockNumber;
    // Wallet address of incentivizor who creates this distribution
    address incentivizor;
+   // Epoch duration at the time of creation
+   uint64 epochBlockNumber;
}
```

And check against that value when claiming:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203):
```diff
-    require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
+    require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % params.blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
```
