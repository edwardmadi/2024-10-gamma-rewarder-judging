# Integer Overflow in  Fee Calculation in createDistribution

## Description
While Solidity 0.8+ handles overflows, relying solely on overflow reversion without additional bounds can lead to issues in fee calculations, particularly if users can set high _amount values. For instance, if _amount is close to type(uint256).max, this can distort fee computation, which might unintentionally limit distributions or miscalculate protocol revenue.

## Recommendation: Adjust the calculation to avoid overflow:
Since the risk of overflow is limited by Solidity's built-in checks and the scale of typical values, a realistic way to handle this is:

Ensure the protocolFee is bounded within a reasonable range (e.g., max 10%).
Clearly document fee and amount limitations in the contractâ€™s comments to reassure users and developers about safety.
```solidity
require(protocolFee < 1e8, "Fee cannot exceed 10%");
uint256 fee = (_amount / BASE_9) * protocolFee;
```
This approach safely avoids overflow by dividing _amount before multiplying.
