# Users unable to claim their rewards due to `handleProofResult` failure

### Summary

The internal `handleProofResult()` which perform checks to claim the reward are going to revert, due to `blockPerEpoch` not being the same as it was initially during `createDistribution()`. 

### Root Cause

Users eligible for rewards can claim their rewards at any point([as said here](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1f793d0-f47e-4433-93e2-f907e0bc1b28)). However, when a claim request is sent, the callback function `brevisCallback()` is called, which internally calls the `handleProofResult()` function, 

```solidity
    function handleProofResult(bytes32, bytes32 _vkHash, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) internal override {
        ...snip...
        (
            address userAddress,
            address lpTokenAddress,
            uint64 startBlock,
            uint64 endBlock,
            bytes32 distributionId,
            address rewardTokenAddress,
            uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            uint248 totalRewardAmount
        ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);

        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
        require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
        require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
        require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
      ...snip...
```

The decoded parameter is validated against the parameters set during `createDistribution()`. However, since `blocksPerEpoch` is subject to change and can vary between 6 hours and 1 day (as mentioned in the README), `(endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0` is likely to revert, causing the entire claim to fail. 

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Incentivizor create a distribution where, 
```solidity
   blocksPerEpoch = 1 days(86500s)
   endBlockNum - startBlockNum = 14 days
   epochCount = 14, 
   amountPerEpoch = rewardAmount / epochCount
```
Note that the `amountPerEpoch` is directly proportional to the `blocksPerEpoch` which means with more number of epoches, users going to receive less reward in each epoch. 

2. The `blocksPerEpoch` is changed to  `15 hr` to decrease the `amountPerEpoch` for the new distributions. But it cause existing distribution to use `15 hr` instead of `1 days` while claiming them, leading to failure(see poc), 

### Impact

### Mitigation

Just like `startBlockNumber` and `endBlockNumber` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L134), cache the blocksPerEpoch also.
