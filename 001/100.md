# Potential Broken Reward Claims whenever blocksPerEpoch Changes

### Summary

Mutable blocksPerEpoch parameter without historical tracking will cause an unavoidable reward claim failure for distribution participants as owner can change blocksPerEpoch making existing user proofs incompatible with the new epoch length

### Root Cause

In handleProofResult() the check (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0 uses the current blocksPerEpoch value rather than the value that existed when the proof was generated

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Owner needs to call setBlocksPerEpoch() to change blocksPerEpoch from initial value to a different value
2. User needs to have generated a proof using the old blocksPerEpoch value
3. The proof needs to be submitted after blocksPerEpoch has changed

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User generates proof for claiming rewards with start=1000, end=1300 when blocksPerEpoch=100 (valid as 300 blocks = 3 epochs)
2. Owner calls setBlocksPerEpoch() to change value to 200
3. User attempts to submit their valid proof
4. Transaction reverts as 300 % 200 = 100 â‰  0

### Impact

Users with proofs generated before the blocksPerEpoch change cannot claim their rewards as their proofs become invalid.
