# User may lose some rewards due to incorrect accounting

### Summary

The `blocksPerEpoch` variable is used both in calculating `amountPerEpoch` when creating a distribution and validating that the block interval divides evenly into epochs. A problem arises if this value is modified after creating a distribution but before it is fully utilized.

### Root Cause

When a distribution is created, `blocksPerEpoch` is used for validation and to calculate `amountPerEpoch`, which is saved in the distribution.

  121:         require(isWhitelistedRewardToken[_rewardToken] == 1, "Reward token has to be whitelisted.");
  122:         require(IERC20(_rewardToken).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount, "Incentivisor did not approve enough tokens to Reward contract.");
  123:         require(protocolFeeRecipient != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
  124: 
  125:         uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
  126:         uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
  127:         uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

  144:         distributions[distributionId] = newDistribution;
```

Another use of `blocksPerEpoch` occurs during claim validation, but this time, other parameters are taken from the previously saved distribution.

```solidity
File: GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol
  201:         DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
  202: >>>     require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
  203:         require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```

If `blocksPerEpoch` is changed between the creation of the distribution and the claim, it could lead to incorrect reward claims. This scenario assumes good faith by an authorized user, such as adapting the system to new conditions, rather than a malicious act.

### Internal Pre-Conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-Conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Incentivizer creates a distribution.
2. Owner changes the `blocksPerEpoch` value.
3. User attempts a claim.

### Impact

The impact will vary depending on the situation and the system data used for proof.

- Users may be unable to claim rewards because the new validation value fails (`require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");`).
- If the value is reduced and startBlock and endBlock are adjusted, users may receive more than intended for each epoch, as the `distributionAmountPerEpoch` recorded in the distribution remains unchanged. If modified in the proof, it will fail validation, and users won’t receive rewards.
- If a user claims more than they should, subsequent users may collect rewards from another distribution’s funds, as funds aren’t assigned to specific distributions but pooled in the rewarder’s account: `IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);`.

I consider this impact **medium**, even though it’s an action taken by the owner in good faith, as the distribution cannot be modified once created, and funds transferred by the incentivizer cannot be withdrawn.

### Proof of Concept

_No response_

### Mitigation

Mitigation depends on the project’s business requirements.

For example:

- Once distribution terms are set, they should remain unchanged. `blocksPerEpoch` could be saved within the distribution and used for claim calculations.
