# No upper limit on totalRewardAmount in handleProofResult()

### Summary

The missing upper limit validation on the totalRewardAmount in the handleProofResult() function will cause a complete loss of funds for users as an attacker can submit manipulated proofs to claim excessively large rewards.

### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder.sol:205](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder-dustinhuel2/blob/7639e4677697df48bf1bf97bbe4dc0c07556391f/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L205), there is no validation to ensure that the totalRewardAmount retrieved from the proof is within a reasonable limit based on the distribution parameters.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The attacker needs to generate a manipulated proof that inflates the totalRewardAmount beyond the allowed limits.
2. The contract needs to have an active distribution with sufficient funds allocated to be exploited.

### External pre-conditions

The Brevis proof system needs to return the manipulated proof without proper validation on the totalRewardAmount.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker creates a manipulated proof that specifies a large totalRewardAmount that exceeds the legitimate claimable amount.
2. The attacker calls the function concerning handleProofResult() with the manipulated proof.
3. The contract transfers an excessive amount of reward tokens to the attacker because there is no upper limit check on the claimed amount.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a loss of trust, as legitimate users will not be able to claim their rewards due to the depletion of the funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement an upper limit for the totalRewardAmount to ensure that no more than the allowed amount can be claimed for each user.
