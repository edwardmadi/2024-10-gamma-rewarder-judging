# Setting `blocksPerEpoch` Can Lock Out Users From Due Rewards

### Summary

The `blocksPerEpoch` in the `GammaRewarder` is reconfigurable by the owner, however changing this value risks incompatibility with existing distributions.

### Root Cause

When creating a distribution, the distribution creator must configure a `startBlock` and an `endBlock` that satisfy:

```solidity
require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch");
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L120C8-L120C133

i.e. the difference between `_endBlockNum` and `_startBlockNum` must be a fixed multiple of `blocksPerEpoch`. However, the `GammaRewarder` allows the `owner` to change the `blocksPerEpoch`:

```solidity
/// @notice Sets the number of blocks per epoch
/// @param _blocksPerEpoch New number of blocks per epoch
function setBlocksPerEpoch(uint64 _blocksPerEpoch) external onlyOwner {
        blocksPerEpoch = _blocksPerEpoch;
        emit BlocksPerEpochUpdated(_blocksPerEpoch);
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L237C1-L242C6

When doing this, we risk invalidating existing distributions, since the `startBlock` and the `endBlock` of a `claim` (previously configured for the last `blocksPerEpoch`) will no longer be valid:

```solidity
 require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202C9-L202C119

Notice here that a previously created distribution's `endBlock` and `startBlock` are still expected to conform to a fixed multiple of `blocksPerEpoch`, even though `blocksPerEpoch` has been changed.

Since distribution creation is permissionless, it is unlikely that all distributions will be compatible with the new range change (i.e. a common divisor).

This will prevent users from rightfully claiming their distribution tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Existing distributions have been created and deposited to via `createDistribution`.

### Attack Path

1. The owner calls `setBlocksPerEpoch` and selects a value that is incompatible with some existing distributions.

### Impact

Users cannot claim tokens since the difference between their `_endBlockNum` and `_startBlockNum` are no longer modulo zero of the `blocksPerEpoch`.

Valid claim attempts result in transaction `revert`.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store the `blocksPerEpoch` against the distribution's [`DistributionParameters`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L12C8-L12C30) at the time of creation, and only refer to the contract storage `blocksPerEpoch` when creating a new distribution.
