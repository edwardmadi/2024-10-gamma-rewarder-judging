# Claim Blocking Vulnerability in GammaRewarder Contract

### Summary

The improper claim validation in GammaRewarder.sol will cause a permanent denial of rewards for legitimate users as attackers can block entire distribution periods by submitting minimal claims, preventing users from claiming their actual rewards.

### Root Cause

The vulnerability exists due to following reasons in `GammaRewarder.sol`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L172

1. **Single claim per distribution limit**
```solidity
function handleProofResult(...) internal override {
    // ... decode output ...
    
    CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
    // CRITICAL: Only checks if any claim exists, regardless of amount
    require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
    
    // Stores entire period without amount validation
    claim.startBlock = startBlock;
    claim.endBlock = endBlock;
    claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
    claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;
}
```

2. **Period Validations**
```solidity
function handleProofResult(...) internal override {
    // Only validates claim is within distribution period
    require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, 
        "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
}
```

This allows an attacker to:
1. Create proof using large periods for an user and then claim resulting minimal rewards for the entire distribution period for an user
2. Block the users from claiming their actual rewards
3. Exploit single claim limit to permanently lock others' rewards



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker creates proof for users by using a range which includes large period where user does not have a supply. e.g. for new depositor include large number of blocks before their deposit or for exiting depositors include a large number of blocks post exit.
2. Submit the proof for a distribution period encompassed in the range
3. User gets minimal reward
4. User is unable to claim full reward.

### Impact

Legitimate users suffer complete loss of their rewards as they become unable to claim after an attacker has blocked the distribution period. The contract retains these tokens but they become permanently inaccessible to the intended recipients.
