# Users can collectively claim rewards exceeding `distributionAmountPerEpoch` in a single epoch

### Summary

The absence of checks on `distributionAmountPerEpoch` in `handleProofResult()` causes a reward overflow in a single epoch, allowing all users to collectively claim amounts exceeding the intended per-epoch distribution, impacting the overall reward distribution.



### Root Cause

In the [`createDistribution()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L138-L139) function, `distributionAmountPerEpoch` is calculated to manage the reward distribution rate across multiple epochs. 

However, `handleProofResult()` does not factor in `distributionAmountPerEpoch` when users claim rewards, leading to a situation where all users can claim their allocated rewards in a single epoch without any cap per block or epoch.

This vulnerability allows total claims in an epoch to exceed the `distributionAmountPerEpoch`, effectively resulting in a reward overflow within a single epoch. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizor created a distribution

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. All the users claiming their rewards which can be more than `distributionAmountPerEpoch`

### Impact

Since `handleProofResult()` does not enforce the `distributionAmountPerEpoch` limit during reward claims, users are able to claim their rewards in a single epoch, leading to a situation where the total amount claimed in one epoch can exceed the intended per-epoch distribution cap.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**Enforce Epoch Limit:** Add a check in `handleProofResult()` to ensure that the total amount claimed in any given epoch does not exceed `distributionAmountPerEpoch`. This can involve tracking the cumulative claims within each epoch and enforcing the limit when users claim rewards.
