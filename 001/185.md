# Potential Partial Reward Loss for User due to an Edge case not validated

### Summary

The `handleProofResult` function lacks a validation check for `(startBlock - params.startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0`. This omission allows a scenario where the user may lose part of their reward from the first and last epochs due to an unsynchronized claim period.

### Root Cause

Incorrect Validation in `handleProofResult`.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. Output from the Circuit as shown in the example below.

### Attack Path

1. Assume a reward distribution across four epochs, where each epoch ends at blocks 5, 10, 15, and 20 (let `blocksPerEpoch` = 5).

```lua

Epoch Timeline:  |----|----|----|----|
                 0    5    10   15   20

```

2. The `handleProofResult` function performs the following validation:

```solidity

    require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
    require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");

```

3. These checks validate that the claim period is a multiple of `blocksPerEpoch` and falls within the distribution range. However, if `startBlock = 3` and `endBlock = 18`:

    * The difference `(endBlock - startBlock) = 15` is a multiple of 5.
    * The range is also within the distribution boundaries.

4. In this case, the claim bypasses the validation, yet it doesnâ€™t align with epoch start and end times, leading to partial rewards lost for the first and last epochs.

5. So, Claims that align with epoch boundaries (e.g., 0 to 5, 0 to 10, 0 to 15) should be permitted, while misaligned claims (e.g., 2 to 7, 3 to 18) should be rejected to prevent reward loss.

### Impact

This issue could cause partial reward loss across multiple epochs if a claim period is unsynchronized with epoch boundaries.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the following check in `handleProofResult` to ensure that claims align with epoch boundaries:

```solidity

    require((startBlock - params.startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim must be in sync with distribution epochs.");

```
