# In `Gammarewarder` Protocol Fees Can Be Effectively Reduced to Zero, Allowing Distribution Without Cost

### Summary

The division calculation for the protocol fee can round down to 0 when a small amount is passed, leading to a situation where users can create multiple distributions without paying any fees to the protocol. This will cause a financial impact for the protocol as users exploit the system to distribute rewards at no cos

### Root Cause

In the `createDistribution` function, the calculation for the protocol fee uses the formula `uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;.` When _amount is small relative to protocolFee, the result can be rounded down to `0`.

### Internal pre-conditions

A user needs to call createDistribution() with a _amount less than BASE_9 / protocolFee to set the fee to be exactly 0.
protocolFee must be set to a value greater than 0.

### Mitigation

Check for Minimum Fee: Before allowing the distribution, ensure that the calculated fee is at least a minimum value (e.g., 1 wei).
Adjust Fee Calculation: Consider using a different approach for calculating the fee to avoid rounding issues, such as adding a safeguard that ensures fees are only deducted if they are greater than 0.
