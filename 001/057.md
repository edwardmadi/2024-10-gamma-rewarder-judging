# User can still claim after the dsitribution period has ended

### Summary

In `handleProofResult:L187`, handles rewards distribution for user but user still allowed to claim even after`` endBlock``has passed. User cant claim twice and transfer only when user call transfer in offchain.All reward is distributed during the epochs and no reward will be 0 left after the epoch has passed . If the user call claim of past distribution then reward of new distribution of same token will be sent even though the past distribution total amount is 0.

### Root Cause


In ``GammaRewarder.sol:L187`` ,  no check to ensure user can still claim after endBlock.

### Internal pre-conditions


1. There should be previous reward distributions. 


### External pre-conditions


1. user has participated in previous destribution  and had been eligble to claim rewards in past distribution of USDT token  but hadnt claimed.

### Attack Path


1. New distribution has been created with USDT token with 1000 amt.
2. User calls claim using previous distribution id and will receive the rewards based on previous amountPerEpoch.  
As the amount of distribution will be 0 which will be taken from new distribution.

### Impact

loss of rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

dont allows user to claim after endBlock has passed .
