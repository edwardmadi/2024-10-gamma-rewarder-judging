# Potential incorrect rewards due to reward period check

### Summary

The lack of contribution validation in GammaRewarder.sol's handleProofResult() will cause an improper distribution of rewards for protocol as users can claim rewards for periods when they had no active positions by submitting proofs with wide block ranges that include periods of no participation.


### Root Cause

In GammaRewarder.sol:handleProofResult() the validation is insufficient as it only checks if the claim period contains distribution period without validating user's actual position within that period:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L203
```solidity
function handleProofResult(...) internal override {
    // ... decode output ...
    
    require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, 
        "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
    
    // Missing validation of user's position existence during distribution period
    require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivisor needs to create a distribution with startBlockNumber and endBlockNumber
2. User needs to have had any position at some point (can be before or after distribution period)
3. User needs to submit proof with startBlock and endBlock that encompass the distribution period

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User adds liquidity  at block 1000
2. User removes all liquidity at block 2000
3. Distribution is created for blocks 5000-6000
4. User claims rewards despite no position during distribution


### Impact

The protocol suffers improper reward distribution as rewards meant for active liquidity providers are claimed by users who had no active position during the distribution period.
