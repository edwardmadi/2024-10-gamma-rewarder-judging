# Precision Loss during `fee` calculation in `GammaRewarder::createDistribution` function

### Summary

In the `createDistribution` function at line 125, the protocol calculates the fee for creating a distribution. Since Solidity doesn’t support floating-point arithmetic, any fee calculation resulting in a value less than 1 will be truncated to 0, effectively charging no fee. This unintended behavior means that for small distribution amounts or low `protocolFee` settings, users may avoid fees entirely, enabling them to create distributions without incurring the expected protocol charge. This discrepancy allows users to bypass protocol fees, which undermines the protocol's revenue model and potentially allows spamming of low-cost distributions, increasing system load.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the line within the `createDistribution` function, where the calculated fee for distribution creation is rounded down.

### Impact

This issue enables users to pay less than the intended fee due to rounding down, and they can even bypass the charge entirely when the calculated `fee` is less than 1.

### PoC

Let’s say `_amount = 40` tokens, `protocolFee = 2%`, and `BASE_9 = 10^9`.

The fee calculated will be = `(40 * 2 * 10^7)/ 10^9`  = 0.8.

Now, solidity will truncated down this value to `0`

### Mitigation

As a mitigation, consider implementing a rounding-up mechanism or adding a condition such as the following, depending on your business logic.

```javascript

if (fee == 0 && protocolFee > 0) {
    fee = 1;  // Apply a minimum fee if protocolFee > 0
}
```
