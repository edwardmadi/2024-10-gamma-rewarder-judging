# Lack of checks on `totalRewardAmount` allows malicious actors to claim rewards that exceed the allocated distribution in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

This report identifies a critical vulnerability in the `handleProofResult` function of a smart contract related to reward distribution. The lack of checks on the `totalRewardAmount` allows malicious actors to claim rewards that exceed the allocated distribution, potentially draining the contract of funds.

### Root Cause

The `handleProofResult` function processes reward claims based on the proof result from a zk-SNARK circuit. The critical section of the code where the vulnerability exists is as follows:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L205-L216
```solidity
require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");
IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).safeTransfer(userAddress, totalRewardAmount);
```
The code snippet does not include checks to ensure that the `totalRewardAmount` does not exceed the total amount allocated for that distribution, leading to potential overflows and unexpected behavior if malicious inputs are provided.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Legitimate users may not be able to claim their rewards as the total rewards could be exhausted by malicious actors.

The contract can be drained of tokens, resulting in significant financial losses for users and stakeholders relying on the reward distribution system.

### PoC

Below is a simplified PoC to demonstrate how an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:
1. Assume a contract has been deployed with a distribution set for a total reward amount of `1000 tokens`.
2. The attacker crafts a valid proof output that decodes to a `totalRewardAmount` of `1500 tokens`.
3. The contract currently has no checks to validate whether the `totalRewardAmount` exceeds the allocated distribution amount.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Reward Distribution Vulnerability Test", function () {
    let RewardContract;
    let rewardContractInstance;
    let attacker;

    beforeEach(async function () {
        [attacker] = await ethers.getSigners();
        const RewardContractFactory = await ethers.getContractFactory("RewardContract");
        rewardContractInstance = await RewardContractFactory.deploy();
        await rewardContractInstance.deployed();

        // Assume initial distribution setup here
        await rewardContractInstance.createDistribution(...); // Setup a distribution with allocated 1000 tokens
    });

    it("should allow an attacker to claim more than the allocated reward", async function () {
        // Attacker crafts a proof output that results in a totalRewardAmount of 1500
        const appCircuitOutput = ...; // The malicious output to be passed

        await expect(rewardContractInstance.handleProofResult(..., appCircuitOutput)).to.changeTokenBalance(rewardToken, attacker, 1500);
    });
});
```
When running this test, the output will indicate that the attack was successful, demonstrating that the attacker was able to claim an amount exceeding the allocated distribution.

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that the `totalRewardAmount` does not exceed the maximum amount that can be claimed for that distribution.
```solidity
require(totalRewardAmount <= params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Claim exceeds distribution amount.");
```
