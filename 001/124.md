# A check in the `handleProofResult` will lead to DoS of the claiming mechanism

### Summary

When the `handleProofResult` function is called, the following check is performed:
```javascript
        (
            address userAddress,
            address lpTokenAddress,
            uint64 startBlock,
            uint64 endBlock,
            bytes32 distributionId,
            address rewardTokenAddress,
            uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            uint248 totalRewardAmount
        ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);
        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
@>        require(
            startBlock < endBlock &&
                (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0,
            "Claim period must be valid"
        );
```
The global `blocksPerEpoch` variable is used to check the outdated difference between the  `endBlock` and `startBlock` variables (both outdated values). This can lead to impossibility for the users to ever receive their rewards, since the global variable can be changed anytime, meaning that the remainder of the devision most likely won't be equal to 0, because of the big range that the values varies in.

### Root Cause

Dividing and outdated value with value that is a subject of a change in present times

### Internal pre-conditions

Owner changes the `blocksPerEpoch` variable value, after the [`createDistribution`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108-L147) function is called

### External pre-conditions

the `handleProofResult` function being called by the Bravis system

### Attack Path

1. User created a distribution
2. after the distribution, the owner changes the `blocksPerEpoch` value 
3. Then the [`brevisCallback`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/BrevisApp.sol#L22) function is called
4. It calls the `handleProofResult` function internally 
5. Then the check is performed and the function is DoSed

### Impact

The function will be unfairly DoSed and a user won't be able to receive his rewards until the owner change the `blocksPerEpoch` variable to appropriate value (highly unlikely, because of the big range)
