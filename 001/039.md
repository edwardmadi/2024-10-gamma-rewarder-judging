# Rounding issues will cause total distributed rewards to not match the initial deposit in a single distribution

### Summary

The rounding issues during the calculation of distributed rewards will cause a mismatch of total distributed rewards and initial deposit minus protocol fees


### Root Cause

In the protocol, there is an invariant stating that 
>the total distributed rewards must match the initial deposit minus protocol fees. 

However, due to the rounding issues that arise in reward calculations, this invariant is not upheld.

## POC

- **Lets assume**:
  - `blocksPerEpoch = 86400`
  - `(_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) = MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` = `9_676_800`
  - `_rewardToken = USDC`
  - `_amount = 1e6` (1 USDC)
  - `protocolFee = 0`
  
1. **Calculation of Fees**:
   - [Fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125-L126): `0`
  
2. **Real Amount to Distribute**:
   - [`realAmountToDistribute`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L126-L127)` = 1e6 - 0 = 1e6`
  
3. **Amount per Epoch Calculation**:
   - [`amountPerEpoch`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L127-L128)` = 1e6 / (9_676_800 / 86400)  = 1e6 / 112 = 8928`
  
4. **Total Claims Possible**:
   - While claiming, users can only claim a maximum of:
   - `amountPerEpoch * total epochs` = `8928 * 112 = 999936`

The total claimable amount of `999936` is `64 USDC` less than the actual deposited amount of `1e6` due to rounding down in the division process. This discrepancy means that users will not receive the full amount deposited by incentivizor, leading to a violation of the invariant.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizor created a distribution deposit of 1 USDC (1e6)


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The invariant "Total distributed rewards must match initial deposit minus protocol fees" is broken, leading to a situation where the deposited amount cannot be fully distributed to users. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Transfer the unusable amount back to the incentivizer to ensure that all deposited funds are accounted for and can be redistributed appropriately.
