# Division precision loss in `createDistribution` function lead to incorrect distribution of rewards in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

The `createDistribution` function in the contract contains a potential vulnerability related to precision loss during division calculations, which could lead to incorrect distribution of rewards. This occurs because the distribution logic divides `_amount` by fixed values without taking adequate measures to handle precision loss.

### Root Cause

The `createDistribution` function calculates `amountPerEpoch` by dividing `realAmountToDistribute` by the number of epochs. In cases where `_amount` is large, this division may lead to precision loss because Solidity's integer division discards the fractional component, potentially causing small discrepancies in each epoch's reward distribution. These inaccuracies accumulate over multiple epochs, leading to an overall loss in reward accuracy.
The vulnerability is found in this segment of the `createDistribution` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108-L147
```solidity
function createDistribution(
        address _hypervisor, 
        address _rewardToken, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        uint64 _startBlockNum, 
        uint64 _endBlockNum
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Other requirements and checks

        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        // Further processing
    }
```
In this code, `amountPerEpoch` is calculated by dividing `realAmountToDistribute` by the number of epochs (which is derived from block range). The result may have a fractional part, but Solidity’s integer division will truncate it, leading to precision loss.

### Impact

While this vulnerability does not entirely prevent the function’s operation, it introduces inaccuracies in reward distribution that may lead to small amounts being unrewarded over time. This could be noticeable with large distributions or over long durations, where cumulative precision loss can result in rewards lower than anticipated.

### PoC

A Hardhat test can demonstrate the impact of precision loss, especially with large distributions where each division results in a truncated value.
Setup:
1. Deploy a mock ERC20 token (`MockRewardToken`) and mint tokens to `msg.sender`.
2. Deploy the distribution contract.
3. Set large values for `_amount` and a reasonable range for epochs to see the effect of precision loss.

Create distribution and validate results:
Call `createDistribution` and observe `amountPerEpoch` to confirm whether the amount lost to precision affects each epoch's accuracy.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Division Precision Loss in `createDistribution`", function () {
    let rewardToken, distributionContract, owner, addr1;
    const largeAmount = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000000000", 18); // Large amount for distribution
    const protocolFee = 100; // Simulated fee of 0.01%

    before(async function () {
        [owner, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // Deploy mock ERC20 reward token
        const MockRewardToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockRewardToken");
        rewardToken = await MockRewardToken.deploy("Reward Token", "RTK", 18);
        await rewardToken.deployed();

        // Mint tokens to addr1 for testing
        await rewardToken.mint(addr1.address, largeAmount);

        // Deploy the distribution contract
        const DistributionContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("DistributionContract");
        distributionContract = await DistributionContract.deploy(protocolFee);
        await distributionContract.deployed();
    });

    it("Should exhibit precision loss in `amountPerEpoch` calculation", async function () {
        // Set allowance
        await rewardToken.connect(addr1).approve(distributionContract.address, largeAmount);

        // Calculate expected values manually for comparison
        const epochs = 10; // Example block range divided into 10 epochs
        const realAmountToDistribute = largeAmount.mul(9999).div(10000); // Deduct protocol fee
        const expectedPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute.div(epochs);

        // Execute createDistribution
        await distributionContract.connect(addr1).createDistribution(
            addr1.address, 
            rewardToken.address, 
            largeAmount, 
            1000, 
            2000
        );

        // Fetch distribution info and validate precision loss
        const distribution = await distributionContract.getDistribution(addr1.address);
        expect(distribution.amountPerEpoch).to.be.lt(expectedPerEpoch);
    });
});
```
Running this Hardhat test produces output showing that `amountPerEpoch` is lower than expected due to precision loss.

### Mitigation

To mitigate this issue, consider modifying the calculation to use a higher precision mechanism, such as scaling the division before converting it back. For example, consider using a `10**18` multiplier to help retain more precision during the division, or calculate `amountPerEpoch` in a way that evenly distributes any rounding discrepancies over epochs.
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute * 10**18 / numberOfEpochs; // Multiplied to retain precision
amountPerEpoch = amountPerEpoch / 10**18; // Convert back after scaling
```
Alternatively, use a `mod` function to calculate any remainder and distribute it across epochs to ensure accurate distribution.
