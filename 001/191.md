# `realAmountToDistribute` could be nearly 0 if fee is high enough

### Summary

The `protocolFee` can be adjusted by the owner after a distribution is created. This presents a risk where the owner could set the `fee` to an excessively high value (approaching **type(uint256).max**), resulting in `realAmountToDistribute` becoming zero or negative. This could prevent users from exercising their options or claiming rewards .


### Root Cause

In[ these lines](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125C9-L127C110) ,  The ability for the contract owner to adjust the `protocolFee` after a distribution is created creates a potential exploit vector. Specifically, if the owner sets the protocolFee to an excessively high value (close to type(uint256).max), it can lead to significant issues in the distribution mechanics.
```solidity
uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;   // Line calculating the fee based on the protocolFee
uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;   // Line that could lead to zero or negative distribution amount
```


### Impact

If the `fee` exceeds the amount available for distribution, it could lead to:
+ Zero or negative distribution amounts.
+ Division by zero errors during calculations for `amountPerEpoch`, leading to failed transactions or unexpected behaviors.


### Mitigation

Implement a check to ensure protocolFee cannot exceed a specified threshold (e.g., 10% of the total amount):

```solidity
require(_protocolFee < 10 * BASE_9, "Protocol fee cannot exceed 10%");
```
