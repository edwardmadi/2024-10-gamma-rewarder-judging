# Distributor can avoid protocol fees for small amounts of low decimal tokens

### Summary

The protocol fee is rounded down, and as such when used with small amounts of high-value low-decimal tokens, it can be reduced to zero.

### Root Cause

The rounding down for computing the protocol fee:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125):
```solidity
    uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
```


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Protocol fee is set to a very small value such as `0.0001%`.
2. A low-decimal token is used such as USDC-USDT-WBTC

> Please note that a Gamma vault for WBTC can be found here [wstETH-WBTC-500](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x8ba02c31565aace0328ea90a17fa86d4ba1ec4d8).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A distributor adds `1e4-1` of rewards in WBTC (which amounts to about `3$` at current price), and as a result protocol fee computed is `((1e4-1)*1e5)/1e9 == 0`.

### Impact

Loss of fees for the protocol on low-decimal tokens

### Mitigation

Please consider rounding up when computing the fees:

[GammaRewarder.sol#L125](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125):
```diff
-     uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
+    uint256 fee = (_amount * protocolFee + (BASE_9 - 1)) / BASE_9;
```
