# Insufficient Input sanitization for Admin Role

**Impact:** High, because it would lead to an unfair distribution to users depending on ``Gamma Brevis Rewarder``

**Likelihood:** Low, because it comes from a setting that has to do with an admin which is assumed to be TRUSTED

**Severity:** I believe this to be a medium severity
### Summary
The protocol fee calculation in the smart contract can lead to unintended outcomes, significantly reducing the amount available for distribution when the fee approaches the maximum allowable value of ``1e9``. This oversight can severely impact fund distribution, especially at high protocol fee rates, and potentially even result in zero  amounts being available to distribute to users.
### Root Cause
The issue arises from calculating the protocol fee directly as a proportion of the total amount, without limiting or ensuring that the resulting fee does not exceed the distribution amount. When the protocol fee approaches or equals ``1e9`` (i.e., 100%), the fee effectively equals  the _amount, leaving little  funds for distribution. This becomes problematic if an admin should set the fee to that amount, as users will receive substantially less or nothing at all.

### Internal Precondition
* The protocol fee calculation depends on ``_amount``, ``protocolFee``, and ``BASE_9``, with ``protocolFee`` representing a fraction of BASE_9 (typically ``1e9``, representing 100%).
* The protocol fee is managed by the admin, who can set it to any value up to ``BASE_9``, directly affecting the fee calculated on each distribution.

### External Precondition
* A high value for ``protocolFee`` (e.g., close to ``1e9``) is set, typically by an admin.
* A large amount (such as $50,000) is allocated for distribution among users or beneficiaries.
* Users anticipate receiving a fair portion of this distribution after deducting the protocol fee.
### Impact
If the protocol fee is set too high:

**Severe Reduction in Distributed Amount:** With a protocol fee near 100%, most of the amount allocated for distribution will be taken as a fee, leaving little to nothing for users. For example, a fee of ``0.7e9`` on an amount of $50,000 would reduce the distributable amount to $15,000.
**Risk of User Distrust:** Users could perceive this as malicious or an admin exploit, damaging protocol reputation.

```solidity
   function createDistribution(
        address _hypervisor, 
        address _rewardToken, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        uint64 _startBlockNum, 
        uint64 _endBlockNum
    ) external nonReentrant {
        require(_hypervisor != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
        require(_rewardToken != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
        require(_endBlockNum > _startBlockNum, "Invalid block range");
        require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");
        require(_amount > 0, "Distribution Amount has to be greater than zero.");
        require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch");
        require(isWhitelistedRewardToken[_rewardToken] == 1, "Reward token has to be whitelisted.");
        require(IERC20(_rewardToken).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount, "Incentivisor did not approve enough tokens to Reward contract.");
        require(protocolFeeRecipient != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");

      @>>  uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
       @>> uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
     @>>   uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);

        uint256 senderNonce = nonces[msg.sender];
        bytes32 distributionId = bytes32(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(msg.sender, senderNonce)));
        DistributionParameters memory newDistribution = DistributionParameters({
            distributionId: distributionId,
            hypervisor: _hypervisor,
            rewardToken: _rewardToken,
            distributionAmountPerEpoch: amountPerEpoch,
            startBlockNumber: _startBlockNum,
            endBlockNumber: _endBlockNum,
            incentivizor: msg.sender
        });
        distributionList.push(newDistribution);
        distributions[distributionId] = newDistribution;
        nonces[msg.sender] = senderNonce + 1;
        emit NewDistribution(newDistribution, msg.sender);
    }
```
**Setup(An edge Case):** Assume ``BASE_9 = 1e9``, ``protocolFee = 0.9e9`` (90%), and ``_amount = 50,000 USDC``.
**Execute Fee Calculation:**
with ``_amount = 50,000`` and ``protocol fee = 0.9e9``, this calculation yields:
```math
fee = 50,000 * (0.9 * 10^9) / 10^9
 =50,000 × 0.9= 45,000 USDC
```
**Determine Remaining Amount:**
```solidity
uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
```
With ``fee = 45,000``, this yields:
realAmountToDistribute
```math
realAmountToDistribute=50,000−45,000=5,000 USDC
```
### Mitigation
Cap the Protocol Fee: Introduce a minimum and maximum cap for ``protocolFee``, such as a limit of 10% to 30% (i.e., 0.1e9 - 0.3e9), to prevent excessive deductions. This can be implemented as:

```solidity
//Copy code
uint256 public constant MIN_FEE_CAP = 0.1 * BASE_9;
uint256 public constant MAX_FEE_CAP = 0.3 * BASE_9;
  function setProtocolFee(uint256 _protocolFee) external onlyOwner {
require(protocolFee <= MAX_FEE_CAP, "Protocol fee too high");
require(protocolFee >= MIN_FEE_CAP, "Protocol fee too low");
        protocolFee = _protocolFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(_protocolFee);
    }
```
