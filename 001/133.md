# Users that claim before the distribution end block will lose the rest of their rewards

### Summary

Users can initiate claim transactions to receive their rewards. It is said that the users can do multiple claims for a specific distribution as long as they provide valid `startBlock` and `endBlock`. The problem is that the second time the user tries to claim his rewards for a specific distribution, the call will revert so his rewards are lost.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder::handleProofResult` we have a require statement that makes sure that the user doesn't claim his reward multiple times for a specific distribution:

`require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");`

However this check is wrong because as we said above the user can execute multiple claim transactions for a single distribution and the second time he tries to claim his rewards the call will revert because his `claim.amount` is already populated with the previous `totalRewardAmount` and he cannot claim the rest of his rewards since the `handleProofResult` will revert every time.

### Internal pre-conditions

The user needs to do 2 or more claim transactions

### Attack Path

Example:

Say that there is a distribution with `startBlock = 127213224` and `endBlock = 127213244` (20 blocks duration)

1. Now a user that is eligible for rewards initiates a claim transaction with `startBlock = 127213224` and `endBlock = 127213234` (claiming for 10 blocks).
2. His rewards get calculated by the gamma circuit and then the callback to `GammaRewarder::handleProofResult` happens and the user claim struct for the specific distribution is set - `CumulativeClaim(startBlock: 127213224, endBlock: 127213234, amount: totalRewardAmount)`
3. After some time passes the same user now wants to claim the rest of his rewards for the rest 10 blocks (`startBlock = 127213234` and `endBlock = 127213244`) so again he initiates a claim transaction and when the callback is called we get his previously stored `CumulativeClaim` struct where `amount` equals the previous `totalRewardAmount`. However since this strcut's `amount` property was already set the `require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");` fails and the call reverts
4. The user is now unable to successfully execute another claim for the same distribution which means his left rewards are lost.

### Impact

Users lose the rest of their rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Do the validation through the user specified start block and end block instead of the claimed amount
