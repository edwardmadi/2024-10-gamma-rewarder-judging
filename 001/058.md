# rounding error in createDistribution can cause user to receive 0 rewards tokens.

### Summary

In  `GammaRewarder:createDistribution`, amountPerEpoch is calculated using (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) where it has to be less than  or equal to ``MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS= 9_676_800 `` which is 4 months where`` amountPerEpoch`` could round to 0 if ``  realAmountToDistribute < denominator ``. 


### Root Cause


In ``GammaRewarder::L127``, round down to 0 if  `` (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch) >  realAmountToDistribute.``

### Internal pre-conditions

1. incentivisor should ``createDistribution``.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. incentivisor should ``createDistribution``.
2. wait some time , user will claim and will receive 0 rewards.

### Impact

loss of rewards for user.

### PoC


consider `` (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) = MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800( 4 months ) `` , ``blocksPerEpoch = 7200 blocks ( 1 day ) `` and ``realAmountToDistribute = 1000 ``.

```solidity 
(_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) = MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800
blocksPerEpoch = 7200 
realAmountToDistribute = 1000 

amountPerEpoch = 1000 / (9_676_800 / 7200 ) = 1000 / 1344 = 0

```
here amountPerEpoch is round to 0 ,which could result in user receiving 0 rewards . As reward calculation is not in scope so not sure of it.


### Mitigation


add this  check to ensure  amountPerEpoch cant be  0.
```solidity 
require(amountPerEpoch != 0 );
```
