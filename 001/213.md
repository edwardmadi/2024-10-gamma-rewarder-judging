# Partial Claim Prevents User from Withdrawing Full Reward Amount

### Summary

A user eligible to claim rewards for the entire reward period may be unable to withdraw their full amount if they claim in a way that leaves unclaimed blocks at the beginning or end of the period.

### Root Cause

The handleProofResult() function allows claims that cover only part of the reward period if they align with the block constraints. For simplicity, we will use simpler numbers. For example, if the total reward period is 100 blocks with blocksPerEpoch is 20 (resulting in 5 epochs), a user could claim rewards from block 10 to block 90, which is valid since 80 % 20 ‎ = 0. However, after this claim, the user would not be able to claim rewards for blocks 0 to 10 or 90 to 100, leaving those rewards stuck in the contract GammaRewarder.sol.

### Impact

Users suffer a loss of potential rewards, as they are unable to claim for blocks outside the initial claim range. This results in funds that are permanently stuck in the contract GammaRewarder.sol.
