# There  could be Dos of  handleProofResult   when the blocksPerEpoch is changed to different block.

### Summary

In ``handleProofResult:L187`` handles claim logic where can user can call from offchain. But it might result in dos when owner unintendely changes the blocksPerEpoch to such value where the ``remainder is > 0.`` 

```solidity 
    require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
```


### Root Cause

 In  ``GammaRewarder.sol:L239`` , change in blocksPerEpoch can result in dos.


### Internal pre-conditions


1.  There should be ongoing distribution .
2.  Owner  changes the  blocksPerEpoch to some value using function`` setPerBlock``.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. owner changes the blocksPerEpoch .
2. user calls claim using offchain then it call to handleProofResult function.
3. which can result in dos if remainder from `` (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch `` is > 0.

### Impact

DOS of ``handleProofResult function `` prevents user from claiming rewards.

### PoC


```python 
consider:
endBlock - startBlock = 100800 blocks (2 weeks)
blocksPerEpoch = 7200 blocks(1 day)

If owner changes values to value below will cause revert:
Values of blocksPerEpoch where it result in remainder > 0 using python.
2160 blocks (6 hours) has a remainder > 0 
3240 blocks (9 hours) has a remainder > 0 
3960 blocks (11 hours) has a remainder > 0 
4320 blocks (12 hours) has a remainder > 0 
4680 blocks (13 hours) has a remainder > 0 
5400 blocks (15 hours) has a remainder > 0 
5760 blocks (16 hours) has a remainder > 0 
6120 blocks (17 hours) has a remainder > 0 
6480 blocks (18 hours) has a remainder > 0 
6840 blocks (19 hours) has a remainder > 0 
```
 

### Mitigation

 The change of blockPerEpoch effects the handleProofResult . Its better to keep blockPerEpochs stored in distribution id , in app circuit as it doesnt affect the rewards distribution and calculate using the stored value rather than new value which will keep function from reverting.
