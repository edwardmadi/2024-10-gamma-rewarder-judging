# Users will overclaim rewards exceeding the allowed total distribution(deposited) amount in a single distribution

### Summary

A failure to track cumulative claims against `realAmountToDistribute` (deposted amount - fee) will cause an overallocation of rewards for all users as they will claim their portions of rewards in each epoch without restrictions.



### Root Cause

In the [`handleProofResult()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187-L188) function, there is a check to ensure users cannot make multiple claims in the same epoch. However, this mechanism does not prevent users from claiming their rewards more than the amount deposited to distribute in that particular distribution.

That means, the current implementation allows users to claim their share of rewards in each epoch without considering the total amount distributed over all epochs.

This lack of restriction can lead to scenarios where the sum of rewards claimed by all users exceeds the `realAmountToDistribute`, undermining the intended reward allocation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizor created a distribution

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Users claiming rewards more than `realAmountToDistribute` which is deposited while creating the distribution__

### Impact

Users collectively claiming more than the total amount allocated for distribution (`realAmountToDistribute`), leading to an imbalance in the reward distribution mechanism. And financial loss for the protocol as the rewards may be over-distributed across epochs

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

**1. Track Total Claims:** Introduce a mechanism to track the total claims made by users against `realAmountToDistribute`. Ensure that the cumulative claims across all epochs do not exceed this amount.

**2. Implement Epoch Limits:** Set a limit on the total amount that can be claimed by all users in each epoch, based on `distributionAmountPerEpoch`.
