# Inadequate Reward Claim Tracking: Prevents Full Reward Access Across Epochs

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract, designed to distribute rewards across multiple epochs, contains a logical flaw within its `handleProofResult` function. This issue arises when a user attempts to claim rewards within a distribution that spans multiple epochs. If a user claims their rewards midway through the distribution period, the current implementation prevents them from claiming any subsequent rewards for the remaining epochs. This is due to a strict check that disallows further claims once the initial claim is made, potentially leading to users missing out on their full entitled reward allocation

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue resides in the mechanism used to track claims within the `handleProofResult` function. The function uses a strict check to ensure that claims are not duplicated, implemented as:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L209C8-L209C64

```solidity
require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.");

```



This condition effectively locks any further claims for a user's specified distribution once an initial claim is processed for any part of the range. The contract fails to accommodate distributions spanning multiple epochs, which necessitates allowing users to progressively claim rewards as each epoch concludes or when they choose within the valid blocks. Hence, a user's premature claim obstructs subsequent claims due to this singular claim check, leading to incomplete reward distribution for multi-epoch incentives. The mechanism lacks the granularity needed to manage claims on a per-epoch basis within the broader distribution period.

### Internal pre-conditions

A distribution is made spanning more then 1 epoch. 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

While this issue primarily affects users' ability to claim their full entitled rewards, it does not lend itself to a traditional exploit wherein an external attacker might benefit financially. Instead, the attack path in this context refers to a scenario where the logical implementation inadvertently disallows users from obtaining the expected reward, effectively diminishing the incentive structure the contract intends to provide.

Setup:

An incentivizor creates a reward distribution spanning multiple epochs, intending to distribute a specified total amount of rewards progressively over each epoch.
User Claim:

A user decides to claim their rewards midway through the distribution period, either at the end of an epoch or during an ongoing epoch.
The user submits a proof, which is verified and found valid, allowing them to successfully claim their reward amount up to that point.
Restriction:

Once the claim is processed, the contract's internal tracking mechanism updates the claim record with the total reward amount for the claimed range.
Due to the condition require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.");, any further attempt by the user to claim additional rewards under the same distribution ID is rejected.

### Impact

As new epochs conclude and more rewards are theoretically available for the user to claim, they find themselves unable to do so because their record indicates that the reward has already been claimed.
This impacts the userâ€™s ability to claim future rewards, leading to a loss of expected rewards.

### PoC

In the case of this logical flaw in the GammaRewarder contract, the issue is straightforward and can be easily understood by reviewing the implementation of the handleProofResult function. 

If such a demonstration is requested, I am prepared to develop and present a thorough PoC to illustrate the issue practically.

### Mitigation

Modify the claim tracking structure to accommodate claims on a per-epoch basis. This can be achieved by extending the existing CumulativeClaim structure or introducing a new mechanism that tracks claims on an epoch-by-epoch level.

```diff
+    struct EpochClaim {
+        uint256 amount;
+        bool claimed;
+    }
+


 function handleProofResult(bytes32, bytes32 _vkHash, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) internal override {
        require(vkHashes[_vkHash], "invalid vk");

        (
            address userAddress,
            address lpTokenAddress,
            uint64 startBlock,
            uint64 endBlock,
            bytes32 distributionId,
            address rewardTokenAddress,
            uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            uint248 totalRewardAmount
        ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);

        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
        require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
        require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
        require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
        require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");

--      // Closing reentrancy gate here
--      CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
--      require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");

--      claim.startBlock = startBlock;
--      claim.endBlock = endBlock;
--      claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
--      claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;

++     // Calculate the epoch index
++     uint64 epochIndex = (startBlock - params.startBlockNumber) / blocksPerEpoch;

++     // New tracking mechanism for per-epoch claims
++     mapping(uint64 => bool) storage epochClaims = claimedEpochs[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
++     require(!epochClaims[epochIndex], "Already claimed for this epoch.");

++     // Mark this epoch as claimed
++     epochClaims[epochIndex] = true;

        IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).safeTransfer(userAddress, totalRewardAmount);
        emit Claimed(userAddress, distributionId, rewardTokenAddress, startBlock, endBlock, totalRewardAmount);
    }
