# The window to collect distribution in handleProofResult is too strict, tokens may be stuck in contract if not distributed

### Summary

`handleProofResult` can only be called once per distributionId, which means that the user can only claim once. However, the function only allows the user to claim between startBlockNumber and endBlockNumber. If the user calls this function after endBlock, the function will revert.

### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder.handleProofResult](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L208), the function allows the user to claim once per `distributionId`.

```solidity
        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
        require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
>       require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
        require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
        require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");

        // Closing reentrancy gate here
        CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
        require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");

        claim.startBlock = startBlock;
        claim.endBlock = endBlock;
        claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
        claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;
```

There is no check for the minimum number of blocks required for each distribution. If `endBlock - startBlock` = 1, then the user only has 1 block of time to call `handleProofResult`.



### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users may not have enough time to claim their tokens, resulting in distribution amount locked in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The check should be `endBlock >= params.endBlockNumber` instead of `endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber` . This means that only when the block number reaches the end block can the user collect their tokens, which makes more sense.

```solidity
+ require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock >= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```
