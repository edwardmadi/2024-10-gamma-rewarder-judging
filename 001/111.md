# Claiming once in first epoch will dos future claim attempts forever

### Summary

the claiming does not work for multiple epochs.

### Root Cause

in GammaRewarder.sol ln 208
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L208

```solidity
        CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
        require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");

        claim.startBlock = startBlock;
        claim.endBlock = endBlock;
        claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
        claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;
```
we can observe that the require statement will pass only if the claim.amount is equal to 0. The snippet shows how the code will then set the claim.mount = totalRewardAmount.
GIven that users are meant to claim per epoch, when the user goes to claim in the next epoch, `claim.amount` will not be 0 and thus the claim is permanently lost and the funds cannot be received by the user. 

This is because the require statement will no longer pass for the non zero value.
```solidity
        require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. user needs to claim for an epoch
2. user must have another epoch to claim for in the future in  the same distribution

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

1. user is in a distribution with more than 1 epoch
2. user claims for the first epoch
3. claim.amount is set to totalRewardAmount
4. user cannot claim for the next epoch as the require statement will no longer pass

### Impact

Permanent locking of user funds

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fix the logic to ensure that users can continue to claim for multiple epoch distributions.
