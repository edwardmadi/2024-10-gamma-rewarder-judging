# Missing implementation on invariant: Users cannot claim more rewards than allocated per distribution period

### Summary
`GammaRewarder` contract doesn't implement a verification logic on one of the protocol's invariants: `Users cannot claim more rewards than allocated per distribution period`.

### Root Cause
`GammeRewarder` contract handles reward claim from users in `handleProofResult` function which transfers the claimed reward to user after verifying the vkHash.
However, it didn't implement the logic to verify whether `totalRewardAmount` is within the limit intended as per allocation period.
The function contains 2 parameters `startBlock` and `endBlock` which represents the block range for when the user claims reward.

As the distribution has `distributionAmountPerEpoch` set, `totalRewardAmount` should not exceed `distributionAmountPerEpoch * (endBlock - startBlock) / blocksPerEpoch`.

### Internal pre-conditions
Any distribution is created with non-zero amount and ready to be claimed.

### External pre-conditions
None.

### Impact
Use can claim more than allocated for his claiming period.

### Mitigation
Implement the verification logic: `totalRewardAmount` should not exceed `distributionAmountPerEpoch * (endBlock - startBlock) / blocksPerEpoch`.
