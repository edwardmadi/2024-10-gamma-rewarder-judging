# A user cannot claim for multiple epochs on the same distribution

### Summary

The protection against double-claiming of rewards will prevent a legitimate user to claim rewards for a same distribution but two different periods.


### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder.sol#L208-L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L208-L209):
```solidity
    CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
    require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
```

The claimed map does not account for the period the user has claimed for, for the given `distributionId`. 


### Internal pre-conditions

1. A reward distribution spans multiple epochs (e.g `(endBlockNumber - startBlockNumber) / blockPerEpoch > 1`)


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. A distributor calls `GammaRewarder::createDistribution` and chooses  `_startBlockNum`, `_endBlockNum`, such as (`(_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch == 10`) for the GammaVault `xWETH-USDC05` 
2. Alice which has deposited into the GammaVault before `_startBlockNum` requests to claim rewards at `_startBlockNum + 5*blocksPerEpoch` (e.g rewards for 5 epochs for that distribution).
3. After the 5 remaining epochs pass, Alice wants to attempt to claim the rewards for the remaining 5 epochs, but is unable to do so because the mapping `claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId]` already has a value


### Impact

Users are unable to claim part of their due rewards

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `GammaRewarder::handleProofResult`:
Instead of having `startBlock` and `endBlock` parameters, consider having only one parameter `claimBefore`, which triggers a claim for all the epochs before it.
Instead of an amount, `claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId]` would store the `claimBefore` block number, and upon next claimings, `claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] < claimBefore` would be checked.
