# Users cannot claim in multiple epoch on the same distribution due to error in logic.

### Summary

Users are supposed to be able to claim rewards per epoch, but the way the reward system is currently built, users will only be able to claim once per distribution so, if they claim the rewards from epoch 1, they won't be able to claim rewards from epoch 2.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the `handleProofResult` function, the function restricts the user from claiming rewards after they have already claimed, but the function fails to account for the epoch that has been claimed by the user, so if the claim token at an earlier epoch they won't be able to claim the remaining tokens at a later epoch.

```js

    function handleProofResult(bytes32, bytes32 _vkHash, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) internal override {
        require(vkHashes[_vkHash], "invalid vk");

        (
            address userAddress,
            address lpTokenAddress,
            uint64 startBlock,
            uint64 endBlock,
            bytes32 distributionId,
            address rewardTokenAddress,
            uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            uint248 totalRewardAmount
        ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);

        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
        require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
        require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
        require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
        require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");
        
        // Closing reentrancy gate here
@->     CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
@->     require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");

        claim.startBlock = startBlock;
        claim.endBlock = endBlock;
        claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
@->     claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;

        IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).safeTransfer(userAddress, totalRewardAmount);
        emit Claimed(userAddress, distributionId, rewardTokenAddress, startBlock, endBlock, totalRewardAmount);
    }

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will only be able to claim once and after that they won't be able to claim again this will keep funds lost in the protocol, so they won't be able to claim funds on the second epoch.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Store the claimed epoch on the claimed mapping.
