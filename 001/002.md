# Precision loss in createDistribution will accumulate and lock undistributed tokens

### Summary

Precision loss in the `createDistribution` function will cause an accumulation of locked tokens for reward participants as integer division truncates the distributable amount, resulting in unclaimed and irrecoverable tokens over time.

### Root Cause

The choice to calculate `amountPerEpoch` based on the total reward divided by the block difference in the `GammaRewarder.sol` function `createDistribution` is a mistake as this can lead to precision loss, causing an accumulation of dust in the contract. The adjustment of `realAmountToDistribute` after calculating `amountPerEpoch` without rounding it to fit into the epoch count results in small unclaimed amounts over time.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. **Incentivizor** needs to call `createDistribution()` to set `realAmountToDistribute` to be slightly more than a multiple of `epochCount * amountPerEpoch`.
2. **Incentivizor** needs to transfer tokens, causing the contract to receive `realAmountToDistribute` that doesn't exactly divide into epochs, leading to small leftover amounts.
3. The **blocksPerEpoch** and distribution block range must be set so that the difference between `realAmountToDistribute` and `epochCount * amountPerEpoch` is non-zero.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. **Incentivizor** calls `createDistribution()` with a `realAmountToDistribute` that does not perfectly divide by the number of epochs, resulting in precision loss (dust).
2. **Incentivizor** calls `IERC20.safeTransferFrom()` to transfer the `realAmountToDistribute` to the contract. The contract receives the total amount, but dust remains due to the imprecise calculation of `amountPerEpoch`.
3. **Incentivizor** repeats the process for multiple distributions, causing small amounts of unclaimed tokens (dust) to accumulate in the contract over time.

### Impact

The **incentivizors** suffer an approximate loss of small fractional tokens (dust) over time due to precision loss during the distribution process. The cumulative loss may become substantial as more distributions are created. **Users** cannot claim these small leftover amounts, and the dust remains unclaimed in the contract.

### PoC

### Mitigation

**Adjust `realAmountToDistribute`**: Implement a rounding mechanism that ensures the `realAmountToDistribute` is a perfect multiple of `epochCount * amountPerEpoch`. This can be done by recalculating `realAmountToDistribute` based on the exact number of epochs, as demonstrated in the recommendation:
   ```solidity
   uint256 epochCount = (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch;
   uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / epochCount;
   realAmountToDistribute = amountPerEpoch * epochCount;
   ```
   This ensures no dust is left behind.
