# Broken Rewards Distribution Logic in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder.sol` contract contains a critical flaw in its rewards distribution logic. Specifically, when a distribution is created, the calculated [distributionAmountPerEpoch](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L20)` may exceed the total available rewards (`realAmountToDistribute`). This leads to an incorrect initial payout which depletes the funds prematurely, thereby blocking subsequent valid claims due to the restrictive `claim.amount` logic in `handleProofResult()`. As a result, the protocol invariant, which mandates that total distributed rewards must match the initial deposit (minus protocol fees), is violated, rendering the contract's distribution mechanism unreliable.

### Root Cause

The primary cause is a logical misalignment between `realAmountToDistribute` and `distributionAmountPerEpoch`. The contract sets `distributionAmountPerEpoch` based on the intended epoch length and total amount available. However, if this calculated per-epoch amount is higher than the available rewards, the initial payout will consume the entire balance. This issue is exacerbated by the restrictive check `require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.")`, which prevents any further valid claims.

Key Code References:
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId] = claim;
require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.");
```

### Internal pre-conditions


1. `realAmountToDistribute` is derived by deducting the protocol fee from the user-provided `amount`.
2. `distributionAmountPerEpoch` is calculated as a quotient of `realAmountToDistribute` and the number of epochs derived from the distribution duration and `blocksPerEpoch`.
3. The `handleProofResult()` function enforces a check (`claim.amount == 0`) which limits each user to a single claim.


### External pre-conditions


1. The `protocolFee` and `blocksPerEpoch` values remain constant during distribution creation and handling but can lead to improper distributions due to these initial calculations.
2. Users depend on multiple claims over the distribution’s lifetime, but the restrictive claim logic blocks subsequent valid claims.

### Attack Path

This issue impacts distribution fulfillment and user claims, especially when calculations result in an `amountPerEpoch` that overshoots `realAmountToDistribute`. Here's a detailed breakdown using example values:

1. **Scenario**:
   - Let’s assume `realAmountToDistribute = 3e+21` tokens.
   - The calculated `distributionAmountPerEpoch` is mistakenly set to `4.85e+21` due to an incorrectly large per-epoch amount.
   
2. **Example Workflow**:
   - The user creates a distribution with the following conditions:
     - `distributionAmountPerEpoch = 4.85e+21`
     - `realAmountToDistribute = 3e+21`
   - On the first claim, `handleProofResult()` will process `4.85e+21` tokens.
   
3. **Failure in Claim Logic**:
   - After the initial claim, the contract’s balance for this distribution is zero (since the amount per epoch was erroneously larger than `realAmountToDistribute`).
   - For any subsequent claim, `handleProofResult()` checks `claim.amount == 0`, but as `claim.amount` is already set to `4.85e+21`, the function reverts with `Already claimed reward`, preventing further valid claims.

### Impact

This bug severely compromises the rewards distribution mechanism:
1. **Invariant Violation**:
   - The protocol's invariant — ensuring total distributed rewards match the initial deposit minus fees — is broken as it blocks incremental claims due to overestimated payouts.

2. **User Funds and Trust**:
   - Users are misled by the initial distribution amount calculation, as they expect periodic rewards that are ultimately withheld.
   - Users’ trust in the distribution process is eroded, as the mechanism fails to allocate rewards correctly, leading to unmet reward expectations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

1. **Correct Calculation of `distributionAmountPerEpoch`**:
   - Ensure `distributionAmountPerEpoch` is properly derived from `realAmountToDistribute` by adjusting for epoch-based allocations, avoiding any individual payout exceeding the remaining distributable funds.
   - Implement a more granular tracking mechanism within `handleProofResult()` to allow cumulative, incremental claims over time, removing the single-claim limitation.

2. **Revise Claim Logic**:
   - Update `handleProofResult()` to maintain a cumulative record of claimed amounts across epochs, removing the `claim.amount == 0` check in favor of a comparison against the remaining balance for each epoch, facilitating multiple claims over the distribution duration.
