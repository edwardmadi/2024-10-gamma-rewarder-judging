# Users can't claim for multiple epochs in a distribution

### Summary
Users can claim their rewards for an epoch of a `distributionId` and can't claim for other epochs due to wrong check here
`require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");`

### Root Cause
The handling of `CumulativeClaim` and `claimed` is done in a wrong way causing loss of rewards to user due to not being able to claim for the following epochs

### Internal pre-conditions
An `incentivizor` has already created a distribution containing multiple epochs (assume 10)

### External pre-conditions
A user is participating as a lp provider and have claimed their reward for first epoch of the distribution previously

### Attack Path
Its not an attack but rather steps for how the issue would arise

1. `incentivizor` calls `createDistribution` with multiple epochs (10) and every epoch is 1 day
   since the code allows that by just enforcing the total duration to be `% blocksPerEpoch == 0` what ever the total duration
   Note!: that `_startBlockNum` must be > `block.number` so distribution only are created for the future
   
2. User provide liquidity to the `hypervisor` specified and 1 day passes and go initialize a proof and call `brevisCallBack` that do its checks and calls `handleProofResult`
   
3. in `handleProofResult` after doing the proper checks we store the `CumulativeClaim` in the `claimed` mapping 
4. Another 1 day passes (second epoch ends) and user comes to claim again
5. in `handleProofResult` we retrieve any previous claims with that distribution here
`CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];`
     In Line 208, now we retrieved the claim of the first epoch
     Then in Line 209, we check that `claim.amount == 0` which is not
     then the txn reverts

### Impact
Loss of rewards to the user


### Mitigation
```solidity
struct CumulativeClaim {

    uint256 amount;

    uint64 startBlock;

    uint64 endBlock;

}
```
As you see above, `CumulativeClaim` has start and end block of the claimed epoch.

Those should have been used so that we check that the user is not trying to claim for the same epoch twice (ensure no overlapping of blocks)

but no logic is build around it and that's where the problem arises,
