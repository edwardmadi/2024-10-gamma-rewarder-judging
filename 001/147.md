# Inconsistent `blocksPerEpoch` Setting Causing Reward Claim Issues

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder::setBlocksPerEpoch` function allows the owner to update the value of `blocksPerEpoch`, but it does not enforce that all outstanding rewards are claimed before making this change. This lack of synchronization between distributions and claims can lead to inconsistent reward calculations, claim reverts, or incorrect token distributions. Users  either receive less or more than the calculated reward, experience reverted transactions, or face reward misallocations.

The `blocksPerEpoch` parameter determines how rewards are allocated and claimed over epochs. When the value of `blocksPerEpoch` is changed without enforcing that all previous rewards have been claimed, inconsistencies arise:
- During distribution creation, a previous `blocksPerEpoch` value is recorded, which may differ from the new value used during claims, causing claim transactions to revert.
- Users claiming rewards with the updated `blocksPerEpoch` setting may receive fewer tokens than expected, or some tokens may remain unclaimed.
- This misalignment creates unpredictable and inconsistent rewards, compromising the accuracy and integrity of the reward distribution process.

### Root Cause

The Owner calls setBlocksPerEpoch and updates BlockPerEpoch as claiming isn't completed yet.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Incentivizor  must have already called createDistribution, completing all necessary setup for distribution.

2. The owner can then call setBlocksPerEpoch to update the blocksPerEpoch count.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The incentivizer has already called createDistribution, but the reward claims for that distribution have not yet been completed.
2. The owner then updates blocksPerEpoch by calling setBlocksPerEpoch.
3. This creates a problem during the claiming process, as there is now an inconsistency between the original blocksPerEpoch used when the distribution was created and the newly updated blocksPerEpoch value.
This inconsistency leads to issues in reward calculations and  cause claim transactions to revert and miscalculation between BlocksPerEpoch.

### Impact

This issue impacts the protocol and users in multiple ways:
- **Financial Loss**: Users might lose access to rewards due to reverts or misallocation, affecting their expected returns.
- **Operational Disruption**: Frequent transaction reverts disrupt the user experience and may deter user engagement.
- **Integrity of Reward Distribution**: Reward distributions become unreliable, as users may receive varying rewards depending on the timing of `blocksPerEpoch` changes.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Before updating the `blocksPerEpoch` value, ensure that all rewards from previous distributions are fully claimed. This could be achieved by implementing  requiring a claim checkpoint for all users. Additionally, notifying users or pausing claims during such updates may help mitigate inconsistencies and improve user awareness.

```diff
function setBlocksPerEpoch(uint64 _blocksPerEpoch) external onlyOwner {
+    require(allPreviousRewardsClaimed(), "Unclaimed rewards: cannot update blocksPerEpoch");

    blocksPerEpoch = _blocksPerEpoch;
    emit BlocksPerEpochUpdated(_blocksPerEpoch);
}
```
