# Changing blocksPerEpoch Can Break Claiming for Existing Distributions

### Summary

The contract allows the owner to change the blocksPerEpoch value at any time using the setBlocksPerEpoch function. However, this can cause problems for existing distributions. The handleProofResult function  checks if the claim period is valid using the current blocksPerEpoch value.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202
If blocksPerEpoch is changed after a distribution is created, this check may fail for that distribution, preventing users from claiming their rewards.
Please check the impact section.

### Attack Path

    -Initial setup:
        Initial blocksPerEpoch: 100
        Distribution start block: 1000
        Distribution end block: 1500
        Distribution duration: 500 blocks
    -Step 1: Create distribution
        The distribution is created with the above parameters.
        Validity check: (1500 - 1000) % 100 = 0
        Result: The distribution is valid and can be created.
    -Step 2: Attempt to claim before blocksPerEpoch change
        Current block: 1200
        Validity check: (1500 - 1000) % 100 = 0
        Result: Claiming is possible, the period is valid.
    -Step 3: Owner changes blocksPerEpoch
        New blocksPerEpoch: 101 (only 1 block difference)
    -Step 4: Attempt to claim after blocksPerEpoch change
        Current block: 1300
        Validity check: (1500 - 1000) % 101 = 95
        Result: Claiming is now impossible, the period is invalid.

    Explanation:
    In this example, we can see that changing blocksPerEpoch from 100 to 101 (a difference of just 1 block) causes the validity check to fail. The distribution duration (500 blocks) was initially divisible by 100, but it's not divisible by 101.
    This small change renders the entire distribution unclaimed, as the check (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0 in the handleProofResult function will always fail.

### Impact


If we assume a scenario where the owner sets a new blocksPerEpoch after the distribution is created, there is a high likelihood that the requirements or checks will fail, and claimants of that specific distribution won't be able to claim their rewards.

To fix this, the owner could look for the blocksPerEpoch value used/set for that distribution, reset it to that value, wait until distributions with that blocksPerEpoch are claimed, and then reset the blocksPerEpoch back to its previous value to allow other distributions to be claimed.

As you can see, the process of setting a new blocksPerEpoch could be quite cumbersome. Moreover, claimants may have a poor experience if they are unable to claim their rewards for a period of time without any clear reason. This would definitely undermine the user experience and the reputation of the project.


### Mitigation

To address this issue, we should track the blocksPerEpoch value used for each distribution when it's created. This way, we can use the correct value when validating claims, regardless of any changes made to the global blocksPerEpoch value.
Here's how we can implement this solution:
1. Add a new field to the DistributionParameters struct:

```js
    struct DistributionParameters {
        // ... existing fields ...
        uint64 distributionBlocksPerEpoch;
    }
```
2. Update the createDistribution function to store the current blocksPerEpoch value:

```js
    function createDistribution(
            // ... existing parameters ...
        ) external nonReentrant {
            // ... existing code ...

            DistributionParameters memory newDistribution = DistributionParameters({
                // ... existing fields ...
                distributionBlocksPerEpoch: blocksPerEpoch
            });
        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
```
3. Modify the handleProofResult function to use the distribution-specific blocksPerEpoch value:

```js
    function handleProofResult(bytes32, bytes32 _vkHash, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) internal override {
        // ... existing code ...

        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
        require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % params.distributionBlocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");

        // ... rest of the function ...
    }
```

With these modifications, changing the global blocksPerEpoch value won't affect existing distributions, and users will be able to claim their rewards even if the value is changed after the distribution is created.
