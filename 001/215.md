# potential funds locked due to precsion loss and flawed design

### Summary

1. creator call `createDistribution` to create distribution. And calc `amountPerEpoch` which means user can claim the max amount per epoch. Due to precision loss when calc `amountPerEpoch`, a few token will locked. 
2. If some user doesn't claim distribution until the end block number, then the distribution amount will locked. Because there is no withdraw function for creator to withdraw excess distribution. 

### Root Cause

1. precison loss at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L127 
```solidity
        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute); 
```
for example. `realAmountToDistribute = 1000` and `((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch = 11` 
the `amountPerEpoch = 1000/11 = 90`, assuming all distribution are claimed, there will `1000-90*11 = 10` amount token locked.

2. This distribution allow user to claim distribution themselves. But if user doesn't claim distribution after end block num, they can not claim it again. so the distribution amount will be locked. Because there is no withdraw function for distribution creator to withdraw excess amount.
