# Users can't claim multiple times when a distribution happens over multiple epochs

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract allows the creation of distributions of rewards for users, who are stakers. Based on how much they have staked and for how long, users receive a portion of the rewards. If the distributions take too long, they are split into epochs. The issue lies that whenever a distribution is split into multiple epochs, users will be only able to claim their rewards only once. This happens due to the updates in the `claimed` mapping, because of the [check on L209](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L209), which is supposed to prevent malicious users from claiming multiple times in the same epoch.

### Root Cause

In `GameRewarder` contract when a user claims the `claimed` mapping is updated from L211-L213, in order to prevent a user from claiming multiple times. The problem is that the updated mapping won't allow a user to claim rewards from a distribution, which consists of multiple epochs, since the next time the user tries to claim their rewards, the `amount` field will already be non-zero. 

### Internal pre-conditions

1. A distribution is created that consists of multiple epochs
2. A user claims their reward for the first time
3. When they try to claim their rewards for the next epochs, errors will be thrown with the message: "Already claimed reward."

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user will be able to receive the rewards only for the first time they claim their rewards

### PoC

The end of the last unit test can be replaced with the following code:
Replace:
```typescript
circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
      testLpAddress, 
      hypervisor_address, 
      0, 
      start_block_num,
      end_block_num, 
      distributionId, 
      rewardTokenAddress, 
      amountPerEpoch, 
      1000
    )
    await rewardContract.claimTest(
      ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
      VK_HASH,
      circuitOutput
    )  
```
With:
```typescript
circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
  testLpAddress,
  hypervisor_address,
  0,
  start_block_num,
  start_block_num + 86400n,
  distributionId,
  rewardTokenAddress,
  amountPerEpoch,
  1000
);

await rewardContract.claimTest(
  ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
  VK_HASH,
  circuitOutput
);

circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
  testLpAddress,
  hypervisor_address,
  0,
  start_block_num + 86400n,
  end_block_num,
  distributionId,
  rewardTokenAddress,
  amountPerEpoch,
  1000
);

// Second claim will revert due to the already updated `claimed` mapping
await expect(
  rewardContract.claimTest(
    ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
    VK_HASH,
    circuitOutput
  )
).to.be.revertedWith("Already claimed reward.");
```

### Mitigation

Include epoch number in the hash corresponding to the "claim request"
