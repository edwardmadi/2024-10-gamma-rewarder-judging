# Loss of following epochs rewards for users fue to invalid validation

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract implements a reward distribution system that leverages Brevis proofs for validation. A critical flaw exists in the reward claiming logic that prevents legitimate multi-epoch claims, effectively freezing user rewards after their first claim.

### Root Cause

The core issue stems from the claim validation mechanism inÂ `handleProofResult()`:

```solidity
CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
```



This validation uses a binary claimed/unclaimed state (through checking `claim.amount`) rather than tracking epoch-specific claims, despite having start and end block in that struct .

### Attack Path

The contract's distribution creation allows for multi-epoch rewards: evidenced here

```solidity
    require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch");
}
```


However,  he claim validation fails to honor this multi-epoch design and only checks for `claim.amount` (which is amount of previous claims)


### Impact

- Users lose access to rewards from epochs after their first claim
- Protocol incentive mechanism becomes ineffective after first epoch
- Economic loss proportional to unclaimed epochs
- Reduced liquidity provider participation due to reward limitations


### Mitigation

Implement epoch-based validation:
