# Changing blocksPerEpoch between createDistribution and claim can lead to incorrect reward calculation

### Summary

The ability to change the blocksPerEpoch value between the creation of a distribution (createDistribution()) and the claim (handleProofResult()) will cause incorrect reward calculations for users, as an attacker can manipulate the reward system by claiming more rewards than intended if the blocksPerEpoch value is changed after the distribution is created.

### Root Cause

In GammaRewarder.sol, blocksPerEpoch is a global mutable variable that can be updated via the [setBlocksPerEpoch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder-dustinhuel2/blob/7639e4677697df48bf1bf97bbe4dc0c07556391f/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L239-L242). If this value is changed between when a distribution is created and when users claim their rewards, it will affect the calculation of how many rewards can be claimed, potentially allowing attackers to claim more rewards than they are entitled to.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The owner (admin) needs to call setBlocksPerEpoch() to change the global blocksPerEpoch value.
2. A distribution must be created with a specific blocksPerEpoch value, but claims occur after the value has been changed.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker or malicious party must be able to manipulate the protocol by changing blocksPerEpoch after distribution creation but before claims are processed.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker waits for a distribution to be created with an initial blocksPerEpoch value.
2. After the distribution is created, the attacker or the protocolâ€™s admin changes the blocksPerEpoch using setBlocksPerEpoch().
3. The attacker claims rewards based on the new blocksPerEpoch, which may allow them to claim more than their fair share of rewards, as the new epoch length affects the rewards per block calculation.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from a loss of trust, as inconsistent reward calculations may lead to disputes or accusations of unfair distribution practices.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

 - Store the blocksPerEpoch at the time of distribution creation so that any subsequent changes to the global blocksPerEpoch variable will not affect existing distributions.
 - Restrict the ability to change blocksPerEpoch during active distributions, or at least notify users when the global value is changed.
