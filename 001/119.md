# A user cannot claim rewards for a new epoch  if they have claimed rewards for a previous epoch

### Summary

A user cannot claim rewards for a new epoch  if they have claimed rewards for a previous epoch

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187-L218

Since the output's `startBlock` and `endBlock` aren't tied to the distributions, startBlock` and `endBlock` , user can claim rewards for one or multiple epochs at once, but doing so will make future epoch rewards unclaimable.

Because of the above code, user can only claim once for one `distributionId` as this mapping doesn't take into consideration the Epochs for which the rewards are claimed. This means that once this mapping is filled for one epoch, subsequent claims for new Epochs will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. User claims for Epoch 2
2. User tries to claim for Epoch 3 but the call reverts 
### Impact

Loss of rewards for user

### PoC


### Mitigation

Account for Epochs in `claimed[]` mapping
