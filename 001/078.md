# Loss of rewards to users due to wrong check and inbuilt logic

### Summary

The GammaRewarder contract prevents users from claiming rewards across multiple epochs due to an overly restrictive validation check that only considers cumulative amounts rather than epoch-specific claims.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder.sol`, the reward claiming mechanism incorrectly validates user claims using:

```solidity
CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
```


This validation fails to utilize the temporal data stored in the `CumulativeClaim` struct:

```solidity
struct CumulativeClaim {
    uint256 amount;
    uint64 startBlock;
    uint64 endBlock;
}
```

### Internal Preconditions

- Distribution has been created via `createDistribution()` with:
    
    ```solidity
    // Example parameters
    _hypervisor = 0x123...
    _rewardToken = 0x456...
    _amount = 1000e18
    _startBlockNum = current block + 1000
    _endBlockNum = _startBlockNum + (blocksPerEpoch * 3) // 3 epochs
    ```
    
    
- The distribution is properly stored in `distributionList` and `distributions` mapping
- Protocol fees are set and fee recipient is configured
- Reward token is whitelisted: `isWhitelistedRewardToken[_rewardToken] == 1`

### External Preconditions

- User has provided liquidity to the specified hypervisor address
- Brevis proof system is operational and can generate valid proofs
- User has successfully claimed rewards for the first epoch through:
    
    ```solidity
    // First successful claim
    handleProofResult(
      vkHash,
      _appCircuitOutput // Contains data for epoch 1
    )
    ```
    
    
- The claimed state is recorded in the contract:
    
    ```solidity
    claimed[userAddress][rewardToken][distributionId] = CumulativeClaim({
      amount: firstEpochReward,
      startBlock: firstEpochStart,
      endBlock: firstEpochEnd
    });
    ```
    

### Attack Path

Consider a distribution created for 3 epochs:

```solidity
function createDistribution(
    address _hypervisor,
    address _rewardToken,
    uint256 _amount,
    uint64 _startBlockNum,
    uint64 _endBlockNum
) external nonReentrant {
    // Distribution created successfully for 3 epochs
    ...
}
```


When users attempt to claim rewards:

1. First epoch claim succeeds
2. Second epoch claim fails because `claim.amount != 0`

### Impact

Users are unable to claim legitimate rewards from subsequent epochs after their initial claim, effectively losing their entitled rewards for the remaining distribution period.

### Proof of Concept

```solidity
// Initial claim for epoch 1 (blocks 1000-2000)
handleProofResult(...) // Succeeds

// Later claim for epoch 2 (blocks 2001-3000)
handleProofResult(...) // Fails due to claim.amount > 0

// Result: User loses rewards for epochs 2-3
```

### Mitigation

Replace the current validation with epoch-based overlap checking:

```solidity
function handleProofResult(...) internal override {
    CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
    
    // Check for epoch overlap instead of amount
    require(
        !(startBlock >= claim.startBlock && startBlock <= claim.endBlock) &&
        !(endBlock >= claim.startBlock && endBlock <= claim.endBlock),
        "Epoch already claimed"
    );
    
    // Continue with reward distribution
    ...
}
```
