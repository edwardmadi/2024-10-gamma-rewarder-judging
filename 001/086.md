# Dynamic Epoch Adjustment Vulnerability: Inflated Rewards from Shortened Epochs

### Summary

The GammaRewarder contract permits adjustments to the blocksPerEpoch parameter by Governance, allowing for flexible management of reward distribution intervals. However, this flexibility poses a significant risk when epoch durations are shortened. The parameter distributionAmountPerEpoch assumes a static epoch length from the time of distribution creation, leading to potential reward inflation if epochs are retroactively shortened. Users could withdraw more rewards than originally intended as the number of epochs increases against the constant distribution allocation.

According to the project documentation, while no hard restrictions are placed on epoch adjustments, it is emphasized that rewards must match allocations and be prevented from being claimed in excess. This potential to break documented invariants makes the issue highly relevant and within the contest's scope. Specifically, distributing total rewards deviates from initial deposits, and users' capacity to claim more than allocated rewards directly conflicts with established safeguards.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the decoupling of the epoch-length parameter (blocksPerEpoch) from the distribution parameters set at the time of creation. Specifically, the distributionAmountPerEpoch is calculated using the initial epoch length, assuming it remains constant throughout the distribution period.

```solidity
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);

```
This assumption fails when Governance exercises its flexibility to adjust blocksPerEpoch, particularly by reducing the epoch duration.

### Internal pre-conditions

Many different distributions are made sharing the same token like USDC and USDT.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

While this issue is not a direct attack vector for typical malicious exploitation, it represents a significant financial and operational vulnerability stemming from valid governance actions. Here’s how the issue unfolds:

Distribution Setup:

Multiple reward distributions are created with blocksPerEpoch initially set to a longer period, such as 1 day. These distributions involve commonly used tokens like USDC and USDT.
Epoch Adjustment by Governance:

Governance decides to reduce the epoch timing to a shorter duration (e.g., from 1 day to 12 hours), within the flexibility allowed by the project guidelines ( 6 hours to 1 Day).
Increased Number of Epochs:

The decrease in blocksPerEpoch results in double the number of epochs within the same distribution range, effectively doubling the epochs in a 1-day period relative to the original structure.
Inflated Reward Claims:

Users who invoke claim operations now calculate rewards based on the original distributionAmountPerEpoch, but with more epochs accounted within their distribution period. This results in claim totals significantly exceeding the proportional allocation initially intended for those epochs.
Resource Depletion and Misallocation:

The inflated claims risk depleting the contract’s balance prematurely, diverting resources from other distributions or future users entitled to rewards. In systems with pooled funds, this could mean users inadvertently claim rewards meant for different distributions.
Systemic Imbalance and Loss:

Such episodes, particularly across multiple active distributions, can lead to a systemic imbalance. The rewards intended per user and distribution do not align with the actual claims processed, breaching the project's established invariants and presenting governance with the challenge of manually correcting allocations or addressing shortfalls.

### Impact

Inflated Reward Claims: Users may claim rewards far exceeding their initially intended allocation, leading to significant financial discrepancies

Deviation from Allocated Resources: The contract's core invariant, ensuring total distributed rewards match initial deposits minus protocol fees, is compromised.

Cross-distribution Effects: As users claim more rewards, the potential to tap into pools shared across distributions (e.g., common tokens like USDC and USDT) may inadvertently divert funds

### PoC

To demonstrate the potential for inflated rewards due to changes in epoch length, consider the following scenario:

Initial Setup:

Governance sets blocksPerEpoch to represent a 1-day duration, and several distributions are created. Each distribution specifies a distributionAmountPerEpoch, calculated based on this epoch duration.
Tokens such as USDC and USDT are allocated for these distributions.
Epoch Adjustment:

Governance adjusts the blocksPerEpoch setting, reducing the epoch length from 1 day to 12 hours, aligning with a new operational strategy or user demand dynamics.
Claims Post Adjustment:

Users begin claiming their rewards after the epoch change. The contract now processes these claims based on the new epoch length:
The distribution period initially calculated for 1 epoch (1 day) now accounts for 2 epochs (12 hours each).
Calculation Discrepancy:

Each user claim, previously aligned with a 1-day epoch's worth of rewards, now grants distributionAmountPerEpoch twice within the same time frame.
This results in claims being twice as high as intended, given the discrepancy from the shortened epoch length.
Outcome:

Users receive inflated rewards, potentially exhausting the USDC and USDT pools faster than anticipated, impacting other distributions using shared liquidity.

### Mitigation

Ensure that once a distribution is established, its epoch duration is fixed. This prevents any discrepancies in reward calculations that stem from subsequent governance changes to the global blocksPerEpoch parameter.
