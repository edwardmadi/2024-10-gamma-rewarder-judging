# Change of `blocksPerEpoch` cause old distributions denied to be claimed

### Summary
`blocksPerEpoch` is used to verify input in `handleProofResult` function. But it's the state variable of protocol and can be changed over time.
Having it changed, old distributions won't be able to claim.

### Root Cause
`blocksPerEpoch` is a state variable managed by owner.
It's used to calculate the `distributionAmountPerEpoch` of a distribution when it's initialized. As well, it's used to check the input values of `handleProofResult` to claim reward for users.

With the value changed, old distributions that are pending for reward claim would be denied due to mismatch of block period.
```solidity
    function handleProofResult(bytes32, bytes32 _vkHash, bytes calldata _appCircuitOutput) internal override {
        require(vkHashes[_vkHash], "invalid vk");

        (
            address userAddress,
            address lpTokenAddress,
            uint64 startBlock,
            uint64 endBlock,
            bytes32 distributionId,
            address rewardTokenAddress,
            uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            uint248 totalRewardAmount
        ) = decodeOutput(_appCircuitOutput);

        DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
>>      require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
        ...
```

Distribution is created in the past, and `blocksPerEpoch` is active variable of protocol. As distributions can go `forever` to be claimed and protocol never know whether the claiming is completed or not.

### Internal pre-conditions
Distribution is created before the value was changed.

### External pre-conditions
User submitted claim request.

### Impact
Denial of Service on claiming rewards.

### Mitigation
Keep the `blocksPerEpoch` for each distribution in `DistributionParameters` struct and do verification using it.
