# Rewards distributed are not tracked causing insolvency in the contract

### Summary

The [handleProofResult()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187) and [claimTest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L150) do not keep track of the rewards 
awarded by a `distributionId`. In a case where the rewards of the proofs allowed 
to claim, surpass the `realAmountToDistribute` for a specific `distributionId`, it 
will use tokens allocated for other distributions causing problems for other users 
to claim their rewards.

### PoC

Let's say a `distribution1` is created with `100 USDC`, with a `10% fee`, `1000 blocks`
starting at 0 and ending at 1000 and a `100 blocksPerEpoch`.

Let's say a `distribution2` is created with `100 USDC`, with a `10% fee`, `1000 blocks`
starting at 0 and ending at 1000 and a `100 blocksPerEpoch`.

```solidity
    uint256 fee = 100e6 * 1e8 / BASE_9; // -> 10 USDC
    uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee; // 90 USDC
    uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((1000 - 0) / 100); // 9 USDC reward x epoch
```
There's a total of `180USDC` in the contract to be distributed `90USDC` to `distribution1`
and `90USDC` to `distribution2`. 

In the following scenario, it can happen that the total rewards of multiple users 
claiming rewards accounts to `95USDC` or that 1 user claims `distribution1` with 
`totalRewards = 95USDC`.

In this case `distribution1` awarded `5USDC` more than it was funded for. Causing
some users in the `distribution2` to not be able to claim their rewards due to 
lack of funds. 

Note also, that in the case that this is accounted with off-chain mechanism, 
`totalRewardAmount` which should be related to `distributionAmountPerEpochs` is 
also not checked and can differ. [check code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L168)

NOTE: This could be fixed by sending some more `USDC` to the contract, but it 
is not an ideal solution, specially as anyone can create a distribution and the 
team will have to add that extra funds for the contract to be solvent. 


### Mitigation

Track all the funds awarded by a `distributionId` on claims and ensure it doesn't 
get bigger than `realAmountToDistribute`.
