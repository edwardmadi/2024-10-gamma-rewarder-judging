# Changing blocksPerEpoch can inadvertantly disable an active distribution

### Summary

handleProofResult() has a number of require() statements that ensure that the startBlock and endBlock of adhere to the size of the current blocksPerEpoch as well as the bounds of the distribution being claimed. However, it is possible for blocksPerEpoch to be set to a size larger than a distribution, which will make it impossible to claim any rewards for said distribution until blocksPerEpoch is reduced again.

### Root Cause

In GammaRewarder.sol the [following checks](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L201-L205) are required for handleProofResult() to succeed:

```solidity
DistributionParameters memory params = distributions[distributionId];
require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
require(startBlock >= params.startBlockNumber && endBlock <= params.endBlockNumber, "Claim range has to include distribution range.");
require(lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor && rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken && distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch, "Distribution params must match");
require(totalRewardAmount > 0, "Rewards do not exist for you.");
```

According to the [contest details](https://audits.sherlock.xyz/contests/496?filter=questions), a reasonable value for an epoch is between 6 and 24 hours. Additionally [setBlocksPerEpoch()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L239-L242) emits a BlocksPerEpochUpdated() event which implies that this value may be changed in the future.

The problem arises when a distribution is created that is valid with one blocksPerEpoch value, but not another. For example, let's assume a distribution is created for an 18 hour period while an epoch is 6 hours. This would pass all of the [safeguards](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L115-L123) in place in createDistribution(). However, if the protocol later decides to change the length of an epoch to 24 hours, it would be impossible for anyone to redeem rewards from said distribution.

This is because claims must be divisible by the current epoch length, as seen in the first require statement. However, they must also fit within the bounds of the distribution range, as seen in the second require statement.

If the claimant tried to claim a 24 hour period, it would pass the first check but not the second because it is longer than the distribution period. If the claimant tried to claim a period that fits within the distribution period it would fail the first check because it is not divisible by the epoch length.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. There is a distribution with a relatively short length with funds remaining
2. Admin changes the epoch length to an incompatible value

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This will lead to locked funds. Neither the incentivizer nor the claimants will be able to access them until blocksPerEpoch is set to a compatible value again.

If the admin is savvy enough to see that modifying this parameter will have this consequence on an existing distribution, then the admin has to choose between locking users' funds or being unable to use an administrative function that should seamlessly work.

### PoC

Please put this in Audit.ts after "Claim Test"

```javascript
  it("Locked Claim", async function() {
    const testLpAddress = await users[4].getAddress()
    const distributionId = await rewardContract.getDistributionId(0)
    const amountPerEpoch = 4850000000000000000000n
    const rewardTokenAddress = await rewardToken.getAddress()
    let blocksPerEpoch = await rewardContract.blocksPerEpoch()
    let circuitOutput;


    // Add vkHash
    await rewardContract.addVkHash(VK_HASH)

    // Change epoch length to one longer than the reward period
    rewardContract.setBlocksPerEpoch(172801)

    // this fails because the range is smaller than blocks per epoch
    try {
      circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
        testLpAddress, 
        hypervisor_address, 
        0, 
        start_block_num,
        end_block_num, 
        distributionId, 
        rewardTokenAddress, 
        amountPerEpoch, 
        1000
      )
      await rewardContract.claimTest(
        ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
        VK_HASH,
        circuitOutput
      )  
    } catch (error) {console.log(`${error}`)}

    // this fails because the range is bigger than the distribution's range
    try {
      circuitOutput = _getCircuitOutput(
        testLpAddress, 
        hypervisor_address, 
        0, 
        start_block_num,
        start_block_num + 172801n, 
        distributionId, 
        rewardTokenAddress, 
        amountPerEpoch, 
        1000
      )
      await rewardContract.claimTest(
        ethers.encodeBytes32String("string"),
        VK_HASH,
        circuitOutput
      )  
    } catch (error) {console.log(`${error}`)}
  });
```

### Mitigation

Consider storing the current blocksPerEpoch with each new distribution and modify the require statements to use that number. This will make old distributions immune to any changes in blocksPerEpoch.

Alternatively, consider adding a minimum length for a distribution and a maximum length for blocksPerEpoch so that the two will never be on the wrong side of each other.
