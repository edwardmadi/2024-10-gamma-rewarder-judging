# Fee structure manipulation vulnerability due to precision loss can reduce the total fees collected in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

A vulnerability exists in the fee structure of a smart contract due to precision loss in fee calculation. The contract calculates fees by dividing the distribution amount by a fixed base of 10^9. This approach causes unintended rounding errors, which, when exploited with large transaction amounts, can reduce the total fees collected or lead to unexpected discrepancies.

### Root Cause

In this smart contract, fees are calculated by dividing a specified distribution amount by a fixed base, `BASE = 10^9`. However, because Solidity uses integer arithmetic without decimals, this approach can lead to significant precision loss when handling large amounts, resulting in fee amounts that may not accurately represent the intended percentage. This rounding error becomes more pronounced with larger numbers, potentially allowing an attacker to strategically exploit fee reductions on high-value transactions.

The vulnerability lies in the following fee calculation code, where precision loss occurs:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L44
```solidity
uint256 public constant BASE_9 = 1e9;
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125
```solidity
uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
```

### Impact
Due to rounding, fees do not represent the intended percentage, potentially resulting in lower fees collected.
Users exploit this behavior by strategically selecting transaction amounts that reduce their fees.

### PoC

The following code demonstrates the issue by calculating the fee for a large amount and showing how rounding errors may cause a discrepancy in the expected fee amount.
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "hardhat/console.sol";

contract FeePrecisionLoss {
    uint256 constant BASE = 10**9;

    function calculateFee(uint256 amount) public pure returns (uint256 fee) {
        fee = amount / BASE;
        return fee;
    }
}
```
Let's test this:
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");

describe("FeePrecisionLoss", function () {
    let feeContract;

    before(async function () {
        const FeePrecisionLoss = await ethers.getContractFactory("FeePrecisionLoss");
        feeContract = await FeePrecisionLoss.deploy();
        await feeContract.deployed();
    });

    it("Should calculate fee with precision loss", async function () {
        const largeAmount = ethers.BigNumber.from("1000000000000000000000000"); // 1e24
        const expectedFee = largeAmount.div(1e9);

        const fee = await feeContract.calculateFee(largeAmount);

        console.log("Expected Fee:", expectedFee.toString());
        console.log("Actual Fee:", fee.toString());

        expect(fee).to.equal(expectedFee);
    });
});
```
The test output demonstrate that the fee calculation does not exactly match the `expectedFee` due to integer division rounding issues.

Output:
```bash
Expected Fee: 1000000000000000
Actual Fee: 999999999999999
```
The discrepancy between the expected and actual fees shows that precision loss occurs with integer division.
### Mitigation
Libraries like `ABDKMath64x64` can be utilized for more precise calculations.

Implement fee calculations using a higher base (e.g., `10^18`), which may reduce rounding errors.
