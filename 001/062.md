# Integer Division Leading to Token Loss

### Summary

`createDistribution` function due to integer division truncating fractional parts, causing tokens to remain undistributed in the contract. This results in trapped tokens that cannot be used, affecting token holders.

### Root Cause

In the [createDistribution](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder-yxsec/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=audit-report.yml&title=%7Bactor%7D+will+%7Bimpact%7D+%7Baffected+party%7D#code) function, the calculation of amountPerEpoch uses integer division:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L127
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
```

This calculation truncates any fractional remainder, leading to undistributed tokens remaining in the contract.




### Internal pre-conditions

1. `realAmountToDistribute` is not perfectly divisible by the total number of epochs, i.e., `realAmountToDistribute % numberOfEpochs > 0`.
2. The difference between `_endBlockNum` and `_startBlockNum` divided by `blocksPerEpoch` results in a number of epochs that cannot evenly distribute `realAmountToDistribute`.


### External pre-conditions

The ERC20 token used does not support decimals (common in ERC20 tokens).


### Attack Path


1. **User Action**: A user calls `createDistribution` with parameters such that `realAmountToDistribute` cannot be evenly divided by the number of epochs.
2. **Contract Calculation**: The contract computes `amountPerEpoch` using integer division, truncating any decimal part.

    ```solidity
    uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / numberOfEpochs;
    ```

3. **Token Retention**: The undistributed tokens (the remainder from division) remain in the contract's balance and cannot be withdrawn or used.
4. **Accumulation Effect**: Over multiple similar distribution actions, undistributed tokens accumulate in the contract, leading to a significant amount of tokens being locked.


### Impact

- **Token Holders Affected**: A portion of tokens becomes permanently locked in the contract, reducing the circulating supply, potentially affecting the token's value and liquidity.
- **Reputational Damage to Protocol**: Failure to manage user tokens effectively may lead to loss of trust in the protocol.
- **No Direct Gain to Any Party**: No party directly benefits from the locked tokens, but token holders and users are negatively impacted.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation


1. **Adjust Distribution Logic**: When calculating `amountPerEpoch`, account for the remainder and add any leftover amount to the distribution of the last epoch.

    ```solidity
    uint256 numberOfEpochs = (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch;
    uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / numberOfEpochs;
    uint256 remainder = realAmountToDistribute % numberOfEpochs;
    // Add the remainder to the last epoch's distribution
    ```

2. **Post-Distribution Handling**: After all distributions are complete, allow withdrawal or reallocation of any undistributed tokens.
3. **Use Precise Math Libraries**: Employ high-precision arithmetic libraries to avoid precision loss due to integer division.
4. **Update Documentation and Warnings**: Clearly state this limitation in the protocol's documentation, advising users to choose appropriate amounts when distributing tokens.
