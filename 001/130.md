# loss of funds for users claiming multiple epochs in the same distribution range

### Summary

During distribution creation, a single `distributionId` may span multiple epochs, there is a check while claiming to prevent claiming if you have claimed before for the same `distributionId` , but this restrict user from claiming multiple epochs in the same distribution range

the following line checks claim status:

```solidity
require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.");
```

This check reverts if a user tries to claim rewards from an additional epoch within the same distribution range (indicated by `distributionId`), once any claim has already been made within that range.

### Root Cause

The line `require(claim.amount == 0, "Already claimed reward.");` restricts multiple claims within the same `distribution range`, blocking users after their initial claim within a specific `distributionId`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

- The user has previously claimed rewards for one epoch within a `distribution range` identified by the same `distributionId`.

### Attack Path

1. The user claims rewards for one epoch using a `distributionId`.
2. The user attempts to claim rewards for a different epoch within the same `distribution range`.
3. The claim reverts due to the `require` check, blocking further claims within that range.

### Impact

Users face loss of funds, as they are restricted from claiming rewards from additional epochs within a single `distribution range` once theyâ€™ve completed a claim.

### Mitigation

To address this, remove the `require` condition and implement a more specific check to ensure users can claim across epochs within the same `distribution range` without being restricted by previous claims.
