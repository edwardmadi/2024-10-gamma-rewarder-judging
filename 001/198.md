# The owner’s modification of blocksPerEpoch impacts the existing distribution.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L239
If the Owner modifies the blocksPerEpoch parameter during the contract’s execution, it could affect the existing reward distribution, potentially causing users to be unable to claim their rewards correctly or encounter errors when attempting to claim rewards.


### Root Cause

In the GammaRewarder contract, the blocksPerEpoch parameter defines the number of blocks in each epoch (reward cycle). It is used in the following functions:

createDistribution function: When creating a new reward distribution, it calculates the reward amount per epoch and verifies that the distribution length is a multiple of blocksPerEpoch.
```solidity
require((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Distribution length must be multiples of blocks per epoch");
```
handleProofResult function: When users claim rewards, it verifies that the claim period aligns with the blocksPerEpoch multiple.
```solidity
require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");
```
When creating a reward distribution, blocksPerEpoch is used to calculate the following parameters:

Verifying distribution length: Ensures the number of blocks in the distribution is a multiple of blocksPerEpoch.
Calculating the reward amount per epoch:
```solidity
uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute / ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
```
Thus, at the time of distribution creation, blocksPerEpoch defines the structure and method for calculating the rewards.
When a user claims rewards, the contract again uses the current blocksPerEpoch to perform validation:

Verifying the block range of the claim: Ensures the claimed block range is a multiple of blocksPerEpoch.

If blocksPerEpoch is modified after the distribution has been created, the new value will be applied during the user’s reward claim process. This could lead to the following issues:

Validation Failure: The block range for the user’s reward claim might no longer meet the validation conditions under the new blocksPerEpoch, causing the reward claim to fail.
Incorrect Reward Calculation: Even if validation succeeds, the reward amount could be miscalculated due to the change in blocksPerEpoch, resulting in users receiving incorrect reward amounts.

### Mitigation

Record the value of blocksPerEpoch at the time of creation in the distribution parameters, and use this value when users claim rewards to avoid being affected by changes to global parameters.
