# Epoch Misalignment Risk: Denial of Service from blocksPerEpoch Adjustment

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract enforces a strict check to ensure that claims for rewards are made over periods that are exact multiples of `blocksPerEpoch`. This design, however, introduces a significant flaw: any modification to the `blocksPerEpoch` parameter after multiple distributions have been initialized creates a systemic risk of denial-of-service (DoS). Users become unable to claim their rewards as their claim periods may no longer align with the new epoch configuration.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue lies in the contract's implementation of claim period validation, specifically the requirement that any claim's duration must be a perfect multiple of the `blocksPerEpoch` parameter. This constraint is enforced by:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L202C9-L202C119

```solidity
require(startBlock < endBlock && (endBlock - startBlock) % blocksPerEpoch == 0, "Claim period must be valid");

```
This condition relies on the assumption that `blocksPerEpoch` remains constant for the lifetime of all active distributions. If the owner changes `blocksPerEpoch` due to evolving needs or operational recalibrations, it inadvertently disrupts all pending distributions, rendering their claim periods invalid under the new epoch settings.


### Internal pre-conditions

The contract has several pending distributions 

### External pre-conditions

none

### Attack Path

The vulnerability related to the strict claim period check does not represent a typical attack vector wherein an external actor could exploit it for personal gain. Instead, the issue reflects a systemic logic flaw whose effects can be perceptibly damaging to the contractâ€™s utility and user experience. 

### Impact

Denial of Service for Claims: All users with pending distributions face a denial of service regarding their ability to claim rewards. This results from the blocksPerEpoch modification misaligning their originally valid claim periods, thereby halting any reward retrieval.

### PoC

Initial Setup:

Assume the GammaRewarder contract has distributions already established by the owner with blocksPerEpoch set to 100 blocks per epoch.
Users are actively participating and expect to claim rewards as their respective distribution periods conclude.
Epoch Adjustment:

Midway through several active distributions, the contract owner decides to change the blocksPerEpoch to 101 blocks per epoch, perhaps to better align with network characteristics or for operational planning purposes.
Attempt to Claim Rewards:

A user, Alice, attempts to claim her rewards. Her claim is based on a start block of 10,000 and an end block of 10,800, a period she expects corresponds to 8 full epochs (800 blocks).
Validation Failure:

Under the new settings with blocksPerEpoch at 101 blocks, the claim period is checked as follows:
(10,800 - 10,000) % 101 != 0
Alice's claim is rejected by the contract due to the strict modulus check, even if her claim period was intended to be valid under the previous epoch setting.
Resultant Denial of Service:

All users participating in similarly affected distributions find their claims blocked, as their claim periods no longer cleanly align with the newly set epoch length.

### Mitigation

Store blocksPerEpoch as a property within each distribution record. Use this stored value to validate claims, thus decoupling epochs tied to individual distributions from the global parameter.
