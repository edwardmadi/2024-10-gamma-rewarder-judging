# Permanently Locked Reward Distribution Due to USDC/USDT Blacklisting

### Summary

Missing reward recovery mechanism when users get blacklisted by USDC/USDT will cause permanent locking of reward tokens in the protocol as blacklisted users cannot claim their earned rewards, leading to a portion of the distribution being permanently stuck.

### Root Cause

When users participate in providing liquidity to Gamma vaults, they earn rewards which are distributed through the GammaRewarder contract. The protocol handles reward tokens including USDC and USDT:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187-L218

USDC and USDT have centralized blacklisting mechanisms where addresses can be blocked from receiving tokens. When a user gets blacklisted:

All transfers to their address will revert
Their earned rewards become permanently locked in the GammaRewarder contract
No mechanism exists to redistribute or recover these tokens

This breaks two core protocol invariants:

"Total distributed rewards must match initial deposit minus protocol fees"
"Users cannot claim more rewards than allocated per distribution period"

Because a portion of rewards become unclaimable, the actual distribution will be less than intended, and these tokens remain locked forever.

### Attack Path

### Impact

The protocol suffers in multiple ways:

Permanent token lockup: Blacklisted users' rewards are stuck forever
Economic impact: Distribution amounts don't match intended allocations
Accounting mismatch: Contract balance won't reflect expected state
Scaling problem: Impact compounds with more blacklisted users

### Mitigation

Recommend implementing a recovery mechanism for blocked rewards:
```solidity
function recoverBlockedRewards(
    bytes32 distributionId,
    address blockedUser,
    address alternateReceiver,
    address rewardToken
) external onlyOwner {
    require(blockedUser != address(0), "Invalid blocked user");
    require(alternateReceiver != address(0), "Invalid alternate receiver");
    
    CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[blockedUser][rewardToken][distributionId];
    require(claim.amount > 0, "No rewards to recover");
    
    // Verify the claim period is valid
    DistributionParameters memory dist = distributions[distributionId];
    require(block.number > dist.endBlockNumber, "Distribution still active");
    
    // Clear the claim before transfer to prevent reentrancy
    delete claimed[blockedUser][rewardToken][distributionId];
    
    // Attempt transfer to alternate address
    IERC20(rewardToken).safeTransfer(alternateReceiver, claim.amount);
    
    emit BlockedRewardsRecovered(
        distributionId, 
        blockedUser, 
        alternateReceiver, 
        rewardToken,
        claim.amount
    );
}
```

This allows:
1. Recovery of stuck rewards after distribution period
2. Proper accounting of distributed amounts
3. Prevention of permanent token lockup
4. Maintenance of protocol economics
