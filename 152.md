# Missing Length Check in `GammaRewarder::decodeOutput` Leading to Potential Out-of-Bounds Memory Access

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder::decodeOutput` function lacks a length validation check for its `output` parameter, requiring a minimum of 178 bytes for correct operation. Without this check, any input less than 178 bytes could lead to out-of-bounds memory access, resulting in contract execution failures. 
The `decodeOutput` function decodes raw circuit output data into individual components, but it does not verify that the provided `output` bytes array has a minimum length of 178 bytes. Since this function assumes a fixed structure, inputs shorter than 178 bytes would cause an out-of-bounds memory access error. This error would trigger a revert, disrupting the contractâ€™s functionality when such improperly sized calldata is provided. This vulnerability is especially problematic if any user input or third-party function can pass incorrectly sized data into `decodeOutput`.

### Root Cause

There is missing of check in `GammaRewarder::decodeOutput` function to validate the length of `output`

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The missing length check in `decodeOutput` can lead to out-of-bounds memory access, which may revert transaction execution and disrupt contract operations. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a length check at the start of the `decodeOutput` function to ensure that the `output` parameter is at least 178 bytes long. This can be done with a require statement:

```diff
function decodeOutput(bytes calldata output) internal pure returns (address, address, uint64, uint64, bytes32, address, uint248, uint248) {
+    require(output.length >= 178, "Output data is too short.");
    address userAddress = address(bytes20(output[0:20]));
    address lpTokenAddress = address(bytes20(output[20:40]));
    uint64 startBlock = uint64(bytes8(output[48:56]));
    uint64 endBlock = uint64(bytes8(output[56:64]));
    bytes32 distributionId = bytes32(output[64:96]);
    address rewardTokenAddress = address(bytes20(output[96:116]));
    uint248 distributionAmountPerEpoch = uint248(bytes31(output[116:147]));
    uint248 totalRewardAmount = uint248(bytes31(output[147:178]));
    return (userAddress, lpTokenAddress, startBlock, endBlock, distributionId, rewardTokenAddress, distributionAmountPerEpoch, totalRewardAmount);
}
```
