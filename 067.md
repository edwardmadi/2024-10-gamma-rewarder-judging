# Front-Running of `toggleTokenWhitelist`

## Description
While only the admin can modify token whitelist status, there is no delay mechanism in place for these changes. If the admin plans to remove a token from the whitelist, an attacker could see this action and front-run it by quickly creating a distribution with the soon-to-be-removed token.

Impact: This would allow unauthorized distributions with unapproved tokens, potentially creating inconsistencies in the reward system or compromising token security.


## Recommendation
Implement a delay on whitelist removals to prevent immediate execution of toggleTokenWhitelist changes. For example, a timelock mechanism could give users advance notice of whitelist status changes.

```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) public whitelistExpiry;
function toggleTokenWhitelist(address token) external onlyOwner {
    if (isWhitelistedRewardToken[token] == 1) {
        whitelistExpiry[token] = block.number + 1; // 1-block delay before it becomes inactive
    }
    isWhitelistedRewardToken[token] = 1 - isWhitelistedRewardToken[token];
}
```
