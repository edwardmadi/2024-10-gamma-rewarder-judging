# Unsafe `ecrecover` Usage in `recover` Function

### Description
The `recover` function in the `Tx` library uses `ecrecover` to derive the `from` address without checking if the signature values for `v`, `r`, and `s` conform to the restrictions specified in [EIP-2](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2). Specifically:
- If `v` is not 27 or 28, or if `s` is greater than `secp256k1n / 2`, Ethereum's `ecrecover` function may yield incorrect results or cause inconsistent address recovery.

This lack of validation may result in the incorrect address being derived from transaction data, potentially leading to unintended behaviors in applications that depend on accurate transaction origin verification.

### Recommendation
Add checks to ensure that `s` and `v` values are valid before calling `ecrecover`, following EIP-2 specifications:
```solidity
require(uint256(s) <= 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, "Invalid s value");
require(v == 27 || v == 28, "Invalid v value");
```
These checks ensure only valid signatures are used, preventing incorrect address recovery and aligning the implementation with EIP-2.
