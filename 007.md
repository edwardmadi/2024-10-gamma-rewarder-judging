# An unexpected change of protocolFee could lead to incentivizor's losses.

### Summary

Owner is able to set `protocolFee` to any value, at any point in time.
The incentivizors that have already called `createDistribution` with old `protocolFee` might not want to use the protocol, when the `protocolFee` is updated, since they will pay more fee than was intended initially. Thus, they will bear unexpected losses.

### Root Cause

There are two reasons the attack is possible:
1. Owner is allowed to set any `protocolFee` he desires (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L246).
2. There is no parameter to ensure the minimal amount that should get to the reward pool in `createDistribution` function (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108-L113).

### Internal pre-conditions

Owner must set a higher protocolFee than expected by an incentivizor that calls `createDistribution`.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Owner decides to change the `protocolFee`, or, in case he is dishonest, sees a call to `createDistribution` that he wants to steal.
2. Owner changes `protocolFee` via `setProtocolFee` with something bigger than it initially was.
3. Incentivizor losses funds, the loss of amount to be distributed will be transferred to `protocolFeeRecipient` (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L129).

### Impact

1. From incentivizor point of view, a part of funds could be lost in case of an unexpected change of `protocolFee`.
2. All funds from incentivizor could be stolen in case of misbehaviour by owner.

### PoC

The attack is fully described in Attack Path section, since it's trivial I don't see a need in coded PoC.

### Mitigation

1. Add parameter in `createDistribution` that will ensure that at least `minimalAmountToBeDistributed` gets to the reward part.
2. Set an upper bound, that owner can set a `protocolFee` to (`maxProtocolFee`).
