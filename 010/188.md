# Rewards that is not claimed for a given distribution will be lost forever

### Summary

In the codebase, there is no function to withdraw rewards that haven't been claimed by anyone, this lack of withdrawal function will lead to rewards being stuck in the protocol forever if no one claims them.

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that while anyone can create a distribution, there is no guarantee that such distribution will be completely claimed by end users, so distribution that wasn't claimed will be locked in the protocol forever.

For example, the total amount to be distributed is 10000 USD.
Let's say 10 users claim 9000 USD total, and the rest  1000 USD remains unclaimed, these unclaimed funds will sit in the protocol forever.
