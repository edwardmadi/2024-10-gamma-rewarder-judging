# A portion of the realAmountToDistribute may be locked in GammaRewarder.sol

### Summary

Users claim their share of epoch rewards. However, the `GammaRewarder` does not account for users who do not initiate a zk-proof, which results in their rewards becoming stuck in the contract.

### Root Cause

The [GammaRewarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L38) contract is missing a `withdraw` function for transferring unclaimed reward tokens.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The Incentivizor initiates a new reward distribution spanning multiple epochs.
2. Some users do not claim their rewards during distribution.


### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The users' reward amounts remain trapped in the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a withdraw function to prevent funds from being locked.
