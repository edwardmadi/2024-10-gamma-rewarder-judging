# Improper use of `erecover` in `Lib.sol`

### Summary

The `ecrecover` function may return a non-zero value even if the signature is invalid. Using the return value of `ecrecover` is unsafe for any purpose other than comparing it with a valid signer value. However, in the `Lib.sol` contract, the value of `ecrecover` is directly used to set an arbitrary address of the decode transaction.


### Root Cause

There are no checks to ensure [`ecrecover()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L137) does not return zero in the `Lib.sol` contract of the Brevis app integration, which could lead to authentication issues later on in the code.

### Impact

Any invalid signature would be treated as valid when paired with a zero address, and because of this, the `info.from` address will be incorrectly set in the `decodeTx(...)` function.

```solidity
 function decodeTx(bytes calldata txRaw) public pure returns (TxInfo memory info) {
__SNIIP__
@>        info.from = recover(keccak256(unsignedTxRaw), r, s, v); // invalid use of ecrecover to set address
    }
```

### Mitigation

It is recommended to use the `ecrecover` value only for comparison with the expected value, and not as an arbitrary value. Also, utilize OpenZeppelins ECDSA package for optimum signature processing -> https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol
