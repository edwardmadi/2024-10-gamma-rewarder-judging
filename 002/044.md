# Signature malleability in `recover()` function allows submitting multiple valid signatures

### Summary

The `recover()` function is used to recover the signer's address from a transaction signature. It takes the message hash, r, s and v components of the signature as inputs.

### Root Cause

The `recover()` function in the `Lib.sol` contract is vulnerable to signature malleability. For any valid signature (r, s, v), there exists another valid signature (r, -s mod n, v') that will recover to the same address. This is due to a mathematical property of the secp256k1 elliptic curve used in Ethereum signatures.

The vulnerable function:

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L133-L137>

```solidity
function recover(bytes32 message, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) internal pure returns (address) {
    if (v < 27) {
        v += 27;
    }
    return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
}
```

This function does not implement the check required by EIP-2 to ensure the s value is in the lower half of its possible range. The `ecrecover` precompile will return the same address for both possible s values.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Impact: Medium.

While this vulnerability does not directly lead to fund loss, it breaks the assumption of signature uniqueness. This could potentially be exploited in protocols that rely on signature uniqueness for replay protection or other security mechanisms.

Likelihood: High.

The vulnerability is inherent in the implementation and will be present for all signatures processed by this function. Any attacker with basic knowledge of elliptic curve cryptography could exploit this.


### PoC

1. Alice signs a message with her private key, producing signature (r, s, v)
2. Bob takes Alice's signature and computes (r, -s mod n, v')
3. Bob submits both signatures to a contract using the vulnerable `recover()` function
4. The contract recovers the same address for both signatures, incorrectly treating them as coming from the same signing event


### Mitigation

To address this vulnerability, we recommend using the OpenZeppelin ECDSA library, which implements proper signature validation including the EIP-2 check. Replace the custom `recover()` function with OpenZeppelin's `ECDSA.recover()`:

1. Import the OpenZeppelin ECDSA library:
```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";
```

2. Replace the custom `recover()` function with:
```solidity
function recover(bytes32 message, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) internal pure returns (address) {
    return ECDSA.recover(message, abi.encodePacked(r, s, v));
}
```

This implementation ensures that signatures are properly validated according to EIP-2, preventing signature malleability issues. The OpenZeppelin library is well-tested and widely used in the Ethereum ecosystem, providing a more secure and standardized approach to signature recovery.
