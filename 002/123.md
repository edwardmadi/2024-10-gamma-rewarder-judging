# Tx:recover() is prone to signature malleability

### Summary

`Tx:recover()` is prone to signature malleability, allowing malicious actors to forge another signature that recovers to the same address

### Root Cause

Signature malleability is possible due to ECDSA structure because, given a valid signature $(r, s)$, it is possible to forge another signature $(r, -s\ mod\ n)$ that recovers to the same address of the first signature.
The attacker only needs to know the $r,  s$ components (by looking on-chain) and the order of the curve $n$.

[Tx:recover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L133) will allow any `s` value, making this vulnerability possible

```solidity
function recover(bytes32 message, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) internal pure returns (address) {
    if (v < 27) {
        v += 27;
    }
    return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
}
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

It's possible to calculate a complementary signature by only knowing the v, r, s components of a previously used signature, such that both signatures will recover to the same signer address.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Adopt a similar solution to OpenZeppelin's ECDSA library, by rejecting `s` values in the upper range of the curve:

```solidity
require(uint256(s) > 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF5D576E7357A4501DDFE92F46681B20A0);
```
