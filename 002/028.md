# Recovering the address from a signature does not properly validate the signature

### Summary

The protocol uses Solidity's `ecrecover` to recover the signature, but it does not validate that the signature is correct or that it did not return the zero address

### Root Cause

In `Lib.sol`, there is a function that recovers the sender's address from a signature - [link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L133-L138). The issue with this implementation is that it does not handle the error case that occurs when a signature is invalid, as stated in the [Solidity documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/units-and-global-variables.html#:~:text=recover%20the%20address%20associated%20with%20the%20public%20key%20from%20elliptic%20curve%20signature%20or%20return%20zero%20on%20error). Additionally, the protocol does not include a check for this.

### Internal pre-conditions

If a user provides an invalid signature, their transaction would be decoded as if the sender were the `0x0` address because `decodeTx` would set it to `0x0` if an error occurs in `ecrecover` - [link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L130).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The transaction would be incorrectly decoded, and users could provide invalid signatures without receiving an error, as the transaction would still be decoded. This could lead to protocol errors.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check to ensure that ecrecover does not return the 0x0 address, confirming that the signature is valid so that info.from does not become a zero address.
