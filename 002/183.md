# Vulnerable use of `Ecrecover`

### Summary

Inside the [`decodeTx(...)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L137), part of the `Tx` library, it decodes a "raw" transaction. It uses the `v`, `r`, `s` to determine the `from` address, which is the account that signed the tx. It passes those 3 values to the `Ecrecover` precompile, which is vulnerable to attacks such as malleable signatures or return of `address(0)`, if certain checks are not implemented properly or are completely missing.

### Root Cause

In `Lib.sol:137` the `ecrecover` precompile is used directly without any checks for the `s` value or potential return of `address(0)`.
