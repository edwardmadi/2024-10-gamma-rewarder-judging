# Unchecked address(0) value from ecrecover

### Summary

The current version of the `recover()` function in the `Lib` contract does not check whether the recovered address is equal to 0 or not.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in a fact that the usage of `ecrecover()` requires an additional check to make sure that the recovered address != address(0) as it'll be the returned value on the failed recovery.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The problem is that the `recover()` function that uses Solidity `ecrecover()` functionality does not check if the recovered address is 0x0 and instead assigns any recovered address to `info.from`. Due to the specifics of the `ecrecover()` method, a failed attempt to recover an address returns 0 and therefore there has to be an additional check for address(0).

### Impact

Unchecked recovered value is updated to `info.from` instead of reverting a tx as specified by the Ethereum documentation.

### PoC

Take a look at the current implementation of `recover()` functionality:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L133-138
```solidity
function recover(bytes32 message, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) internal pure returns (address) {
        if (v < 27) {
            v += 27;
        }
        return ecrecover(message, v, r, s);
```

The function uses Solidity ecrecover() method to derive the signer's address under the hood. From the Solidity docs:

https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.24/units-and-global-variables.html#mathematical-and-cryptographic-functions

```solidity
recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error.
```
However, the address(0) which should not be the case in the correct implementation.

### Mitigation

Check address(0) value so that the contract correctly updates the `info.from` value and does not deviate from the Solidity spec.
