### Summary

The audited `Lib.sol` contains a function that utilizes `ecrecover` to recover the signerâ€™s address from a given message and its associated signature parameters (`r`, `s`, and `v`). However, this implementation is vulnerable to signature malleability, which can lead to incorrect validation of signatures and potential security issues, such as replay attacks.

### Vulnerability Detail

**Signature Malleability**: The current implementation allows for multiple valid signatures for the same message due to the lack of restrictions on the `s` value and insufficient validation of the `v` value. 
Specifically:
- `s` can take values in both the lower and upper halves of the curve, which means that a signature can be modified (malleated) to create another valid signature without changing the underlying message.
- `v` is adjusted only if it is less than 27, not covering all potential variations of v that may arise from different signature generation libraries.
    
### Impact

- Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to generate alternative signatures that are accepted by the contract, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or replaying valid transactions.
- The trustworthiness of signature verification is compromised, which is critical in scenarios involving fund transfers, access controls, or any operations relying on user signatures.

### Tool used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to use the OpenZeppelin `ECDSA` library, which incorporates best practices to ensure signature uniqueness and validity:

Use OpenZeppelin `ECDSA`: Replace the existing recover function with the OpenZeppelin implementation, which enforces the following:
-  `s` is constrained to the lower half of the curve.
-  `v` is validated to be either 27 or 28.
-   Ensures that the recovered address is not zero.

Example of the recommended implementation:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/ECDSA.sol";

function recover(bytes32 message, bytes32 r, bytes32 s, uint8 v) internal pure returns (address) {
    return ECDSA.recover(message, v, r, s);
}
```
