# Lack of proper validation and malleability checks in ecrecover()

### Summary

The absence of malleability checks and validation of v, r, and s values in the ecrecover() function will cause incorrect signature verification for users as an attacker can submit non-canonical signatures or forged values to bypass security checks and potentially gain unauthorized access.
No validation of v (27 or 28) and s (lower half of the curve), can allow non-standard or manipulated signatures.

### Root Cause

In Solidityâ€™s [ecrecover()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L137) function, missing validation for v, r, and s values can allow non-canonical signatures or malleable signatures to bypass signature verification checks, potentially leading to replay attacks or signature forgery.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The contract must rely on ecrecover() for authentication or verification without performing additional checks on v, r, and s values.
2. There must be no validation for the s value to ensure it is in the lower half of the elliptic curve, and v must not be restricted to 27 or 28.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker needs to generate a non-canonical or manipulated signature (e.g., using an upper-half s value) that will bypass the signature validation process.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a manipulated signature with a valid hash but an alternative, non-canonical s value (upper half of the elliptic curve).
2. The contract calls ecrecover() to validate the signature without checking that v is 27 or 28, and without enforcing that s is in the lower half of the curve.
3. The manipulated signature is accepted as valid, allowing the attacker to forge access or perform unauthorized actions.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from replay attacks, where attackers can replay non-standard signatures that were accepted due to incorrect validation.
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass security checks, gaining unauthorized access or permissions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement checks on v, r, and s values before using ecrecover() for validation.
Add Canonical Check: Only accept signatures where s is in the lower half of the curve (s < secp256k1n/2) and v is 27 or 28.
```solidity
require(uint256(s) <= 0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, "Invalid 's' value");
require(v == 27 || v == 28, "Invalid 'v' value");
```
