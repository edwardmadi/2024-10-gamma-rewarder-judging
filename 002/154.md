# Missing `address(0)` Check after `ecrecover` Result in `decodeTx`

### Summary

The decodeTx function uses ecrecover to derive the sender address (from) but does not check if ecrecover returns address(0). If ecrecover fails due to invalid signature parameters, it returns address(0), which can lead to potential logic flaws.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- An attacker provides manipulated signature values (r, s, or v) that cause ecrecover to fail, resulting in address(0).
- The contract incorrectly accepts or processes the transaction with address(0) as the sender, bypassing security assumptions about valid sender addresses.

### Impact

Unintended acceptance of transactions with invalid sender addresses.

### Mitigation

Implement the `address(0)` check after `ecrecover` usage
```solidity
require(info.from != address(0), "Invalid address 0");
```
