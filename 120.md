# USDT is a fee-on-transfer token

### Summary

In the README is stated that the protocol will support only standard ERC20 tokens with no fee-on-transfer tokens. In the code is missed that USDT itself is a fee-on-transfer token. This is a big miss, which will lead to problems every time a user calls the `createDistribution` function.

### Root Cause

Usage of usdt and absence of a fee-on-transfer token transfer pattern 

### Internal pre-conditions

[`createDistribution`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108-L147) function being called 

### External pre-conditions

USDT charging fee on transfer

### Attack Path

1. User calls the `createDistribution` function and it is compromised in the following block of code, where the `amountPerEpoch` variable is wrongly accounted for, since the received amount will be less than  `realAmountToDistribute`:
```javascript
  uint256 fee = (_amount * protocolFee) / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;
        uint256 amountPerEpoch = realAmountToDistribute /
            ((_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) / blocksPerEpoch);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            protocolFeeRecipient,
            fee
        );
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            realAmountToDistribute
        );

```

### Impact

This will lead to wrong accounting in the system and maybe to unexpected behaviour from the `handleProofResult` function, and particularly  this check:
```javascript
 require(
            lpTokenAddress == params.hypervisor &&
                rewardTokenAddress == params.rewardToken &&
@>                distributionAmountPerEpoch == params.distributionAmountPerEpoch,
            "Distribution params must match"
        );
```
