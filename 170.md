# In `lib.sol` Assumption About Transaction Length Causes Potential Overflow and Transaction Decoding Failures

### Summary

The assumption that the length of the RLP-encoded transaction data (lenBytes) will not exceed 2 bytes can lead to overflow or decoding failures in scenarios where the transaction size is unusually large. This issue could potentially cause transaction failures or be exploited by an attacker to submit oversized transactions, leading to undefined behavior in the contract

### Root Cause

In `decodeTx()`  The contract assumes that the size of the length field in RLP-encoded transaction data will not exceed 2 bytes. However, transactions containing large data fields or batched Layer 2 transactions could easily surpass this size, breaking the assumption.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `txRaw` (RLP-encoded transaction) must have an unusually large size that exceeds 2^16 bytes.
The transaction's length field is encoded with more than 2 bytes, leading to an incorrect calculation of lenBytes.


### External pre-conditions

Layer 2 (Optimism) transaction batching with numerous transactions or transactions containing large data fields.
An attacker could craft a malicious transaction with excessively large data to cause the length of the RLP-encoded transaction to exceed 2^16 bytes.

### Attack Path

An attacker crafts a transaction with an excessively large data field or transaction batch that results in a RLP-encoded transaction size exceeding 2^16 bytes.
The transaction is submitted to the contract on the Optimism network.
The function decodeTx() is called, but due to the assumption about lenBytes, the length field is incorrectly parsed.
The incorrect length parsing causes the contract to either revert or improperly decode the transaction.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from transaction decoding failures, preventing legitimate transactions from being processed correctly.
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to submit oversized transactions that the contract cannot handle, leading to potential Denial of Service (DoS) or reversion of critical functions.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Explicitly check the length of lenBytes and handle cases where the RLP-encoded transaction size exceeds the assumed 2 bytes.
