# valid block number range is not listed so there is no limit for reward distribution starting.

### Summary

In ``createDistribution``, the block number is not correctly defined only the the range is defined from 1 to 4 months .
which can allows incentivisors to create distribution where the block lies in future, and the distribution will only start when the ``blockEnd > blockStart.``

### Root Cause

In ``GammaRewarder.sol:L108``, there is no check for valid block number , it  could be  used using  future blocks .

### Internal pre-conditions

1.  incentivisors should create distribution using future blocks but maintaining within range 4 weeks.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

 1. incentivisor  creates dsitribution using future block.

### Impact

user will need to wait a long time to claim their rewards

### PoC


 
```python
consider the current block number is 21047143
1 year in seconds = 31536000 sec
avg block time = 12 sec
blocks = 31535000 / 12 = 2628000 blocks
estimate = current block number + 2628000 = 23675143 blocks
add 2 weeks to 23675143 blocks would be 23775943 blocks 
startBlock = 23675143
endBlocks = 23775943

dstribution will pass these values because there is no check to inforce this. 
now user cant claim because user needs to pass endBlocks to claim.
```


### Mitigation

 add a valid block range where user dont have to wait for a very long time to claim their rewards.
