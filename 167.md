# Unbound rlp length decoding in decodeTx function leading to corrupted decoding

### Summary

The [decodeTx](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L80) function assumes that the input byte array txRaw and the resultant values array from [RLP](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L85C8-L93C40) decoding will always meet certain length requirements. However, these assumptions are not enforced with proper validations. This oversight may lead to:
    1. Out-of-bounds access on the txRaw byte array if its length is less than expected.
    2. Accessing elements in the values array without checking its length, which can result in accessing non-existent indices.
    3. Manipulation of the lenBytes and unsignedTxRawDataLength calculations that could produce invalid lengths, leading to further out-of-bounds issues.

### Root Cause

The decodeTx (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L80) function lacks adequate input validation, which can lead to out-of-bounds access when slicing the txRaw bytes array and accessing the values array leading to corrupted decoding of transaction data.

### Impact

The decodeTx function lacks adequate input validation, which can lead to out-of-bounds access when slicing the txRaw bytes array and accessing the values array. This vulnerability may result in corrupted decoding of transaction data, causing unexpected behavior, potential data loss, or denial of service within the application.

### Mitigation

Recommended Mitigation Steps:
    
1. Input Length Validation:
        ◦ Before accessing or slicing txRaw, ensure that it has the required length:

```solidity
       require(txRaw.length >= 67, "txRaw is too short");
```

  2. Check Length of values:
        ◦ Validate the length of the values array after converting rlpData to ensure it contains at least 12 items:

```solidity
       require(values.length >= 12, "Insufficient RLP items");
```

  3. Prefix and Length Validations:
        ◦ Ensure that the prefix and computed lenBytes values are valid before using them.
