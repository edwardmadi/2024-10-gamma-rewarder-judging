# Insufficient balance handling in `createDistribution` function will lead to transaction failures, revert errors, and unexpected user experience issues during the execution in `GammaRewarder.sol`

### Summary

The `createDistribution` function lacks a check to verify if the caller (`msg.sender`) has sufficient balance of `_rewardToken` before attempting transfers. This oversight can lead to transaction failures, revert errors, and unexpected user experience issues during the execution of `createDistribution`.

### Root Cause

In the `createDistribution` function, a series of requirements are checked before transferring tokens from `msg.sender` to the contract and protocol fee recipient. However, there is no check to confirm that `msg.sender` holds enough `_rewardToken` balance to satisfy `_amount`, the requested distribution amount. This vulnerability can result in failed transfers if the user’s balance is insufficient, creating unintended reverts and preventing proper fund handling.

The following code shows the vulnerability within the `createDistribution` function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L108-L147
```solidity
function createDistribution(
        address _hypervisor, 
        address _rewardToken, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        uint64 _startBlockNum, 
        uint64 _endBlockNum
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Other requirements ...
        
        require(IERC20(_rewardToken).allowance(msg.sender, address(this)) >= _amount, "Incentivisor did not approve enough tokens to Reward contract.");

        // Vulnerable Code: Missing balance check
        uint256 fee = _amount * protocolFee / BASE_9;
        uint256 realAmountToDistribute = _amount - fee;

        // Token transfers (potential to fail without balance check)
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, protocolFeeRecipient, fee);
        IERC20(_rewardToken).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), realAmountToDistribute);

        // Further processing ...
    }
```

### Impact

The missing balance check leads to unnecessary reverts and unexpected transaction failures, which impacts user experience. While this issue does not cause a direct financial loss, it creates operational inefficiencies and may leave users confused about the cause of transaction failure.

### PoC

To demonstrate this issue, let's conduct a Hardhat test where `msg.sender` tries to execute `createDistribution` without sufficient balance of `_rewardToken`.
Setup:
1. Deploy a mock ERC20 token contract (`MockRewardToken`).
2. Deploy the contract containing `createDistribution`.
3. Mint tokens to `msg.sender`, ensuring their balance is less than `_amount`.

Attempt to create distribution:
1. Call `createDistribution` with `_amount` set higher than `msg.sender`’s balance.
2. The test expects a revert due to insufficient balance.
```javascript
const { expect } = require("chai");
const { ethers } = require("hardhat");

describe("Insufficient Balance Handling in createDistribution", function () {
    let rewardToken, distributionContract, owner, addr1;
    const amountToDistribute = ethers.utils.parseUnits("1000", 18); // High amount

    before(async function () {
        [owner, addr1] = await ethers.getSigners();

        // Deploy a mock reward token
        const MockRewardToken = await ethers.getContractFactory("MockRewardToken");
        rewardToken = await MockRewardToken.deploy("Reward Token", "RTK", 18);
        await rewardToken.deployed();

        // Mint tokens to addr1 with insufficient balance for test
        await rewardToken.mint(addr1.address, ethers.utils.parseUnits("100", 18)); // Low balance

        // Deploy distribution contract
        const DistributionContract = await ethers.getContractFactory("DistributionContract");
        distributionContract = await DistributionContract.deploy();
        await distributionContract.deployed();
    });

    it("Should revert due to insufficient balance in createDistribution", async function () {
        // Set allowance but not enough balance
        await rewardToken.connect(addr1).approve(distributionContract.address, amountToDistribute);

        // Attempt to create distribution and expect revert due to low balance
        await expect(
            distributionContract.connect(addr1).createDistribution(
                addr1.address, 
                rewardToken.address, 
                amountToDistribute, 
                1000, 
                2000
            )
        ).to.be.revertedWith("ERC20: transfer amount exceeds balance");
    });
});
```

### Mitigation

To prevent this issue, add a balance check for `msg.sender`’s balance of `_rewardToken` at the beginning of the function:
```solidity
require(IERC20(_rewardToken).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= _amount, "Insufficient balance");
```
Adding this line will ensure that users cannot initiate a distribution with an amount they do not possess, thus preventing avoidable transaction reverts.
