# Users can only execute one claim for distribution.

### Summary

If a user has 2 claims for different block ranges inside the same distribution. 
He will only be able to claim the first one, the second will always revert due to 
[GammaRewarder.sol#L172](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L172). Causing their funds to get stuck in the contract.

### PoC

Assume there is a distribution created with a range from block 100-1000.
Let's say Bob has two valid claims for the same distribution:
1. Claim with range from block 200 - 400.
2. Claim with range from block 700 - 900.

In this scenario, Bob will only be able to claim his first claim as the second
one will always revert due to `claim.amount > 0` for the `distributionId`.


### Mitigation

Consider checking the block ranges to not overlap, instead of the claim amount.
