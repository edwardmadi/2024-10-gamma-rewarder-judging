# The prefix does not correspond to the EIP-2718 typed transaction when encoding `unsignedTxRaw`

### Summary

Currently, the prefix does exceed the maximum value for the EIP-2718 typed transaction when `unsignedTxRaw` data is encoded.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in a fact that the contract `Lib.sol` does not take into account the EIP-2718 transaction type prefix range.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The function will assign incorrect prefix for the `unsignedTxRaw` and it would not be able to recover the signer as the signer would put a different prefix (correct prefix) for an EIP-2718 typed transaction.

### Impact

The signer would be incorrectly recovered as the signed data would significantly differ (at least in a set prefix value) from `unsignedTxRaw` value that's encoded.

### PoC

Let's take a look at how the `unsignedTxRaw` value is currently constructed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L110-130
```solidity
 if (unsignedTxRawDataLength <= 55) {
            unsignedTxRaw = abi.encodePacked(txRaw[:2], txRaw[3:txRaw.length - 67]);
            unsignedTxRaw[1] = bytes1(0xc0 + uint8(unsignedTxRawDataLength));
        } else {
            if (unsignedTxRawDataLength <= 255) {
                unsignedTxRaw = abi.encodePacked(
                    txRaw[0],
                    bytes1(0xf8),
                    bytes1(uint8(unsignedTxRawDataLength)),
                    txRaw[2 + lenBytes:txRaw.length - 67]
                );
            } else {
                unsignedTxRaw = abi.encodePacked(
                    txRaw[0],
                    bytes1(0xf9),
                    bytes2(unsignedTxRawDataLength),
                    txRaw[2 + lenBytes:txRaw.length - 67]
                );
            }
        }
        info.from = recover(keccak256(unsignedTxRaw), r, s, v);

```

So it first checks the `unsignedTxRawDataLength` and, according to this value, encodes the `unsignedTxRaw` data. However, it both cases in puts `0xf9` and `0xf8` prefixes as the prefix of a transaction. The problem is that such a prefix differs from the maximum value of a EIP-2718 typed transaction (that EIP-1559 spec follows):

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718
```solidity
Clients can differentiate between the legacy transactions and typed transactions by looking at the first byte. If it starts with a value in the range [0, 0x7f] then it is a new transaction type, if it starts with a value in the range [0xc0, 0xfe] then it is a legacy transaction type. 0xff is not realistic for an RLP encoded transaction, so it is reserved for future use as an extension sentinel value.
```

So the maximum value that the prefix might have is `0x7f` but currently provided prefixes (0xf8 and 0xf9) are bigger than this value.

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md
```solidity
We introduce a new [EIP-2718](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2718.md) transaction type, with the format 0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s]).
```

As you can see here, the prefix is `0x02` that is significantly less of the `0x7f` value. This would cause the `unsignedTxRaw` data to have an incorrect prefix that would differ from the actual data provided by a user for a type2 transaction and result in an error when recovering an address of a signer.

### Mitigation

Assign the correct prefix value according to the type2 transaction spec.
