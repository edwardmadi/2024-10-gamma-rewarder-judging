# Potential Hash Collisions in Distribution ID Generation Due to abi.encodePacked Usage

### Summary

The use of abi.encodePacked in the `decodeTx` function will cause data collisions and ambiguity when concatenating dynamic byte arrays. This can lead to incorrect transaction data reconstruction, resulting in potential transaction reverts and security vulnerabilities, as attackers may exploit the ambiguous data to manipulate transaction signatures.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol`, the decodeTx function employs abi.encodePacked to concatenate slices of txRaw. Specifically
uses `abi.encodePacked` to combine txRaw[:2] and txRaw.length - 67. Since `abi.encodePacked` does not include delimiters or length prefixes between dynamic types, this can lead to data collisions and ambiguity during data reconstruction.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Two different combinations of sender address and nonce that result in the same packed value
2. Distribution creation with colliding parameters

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker identifies sender/nonce combinations that produce identical packed values
2. Creates distribution with first combination
3. Creates another distribution with second combination
4. Both distributions map to same ID, corrupting distribution tracking

### Impact

The protocol suffers from potential transaction reverts and unauthorized manipulation of transaction data. Users may experience failed transactions or unintended behaviors, while attackers gain the ability to manipulate transaction signatures and exploit the contract's transaction processing logic.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

o prevent data collisions and ensure the integrity of transaction data reconstruction, abi.encodePacked should be replaced with abi.encode
