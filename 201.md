# No Active Stakers Causes Reward Funds to Be Permanently Unclaimable

### Summary

The absence of active stakers in an epoch will cause rewards to become permanently stuck in the contract GammaRewarder.sol, as no eligible participants exist to claim them and a sweeping functions is lacking.


### Root Cause

The distribution mechanism in the createDistribution() and claim() functions does not account for cases where no stakers are present in an epoch. Additionally, the contract lacks a sweep function to allow an admin or authorized party to withdraw unclaimed funds, leaving these rewards permanently locked in the contract.
