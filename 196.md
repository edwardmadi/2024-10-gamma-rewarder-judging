# Risk of Timing Manipulation During Fee Adjustments

### Summary

The ownerâ€™s ability to adjust the `protocolFee` immediately before crucial transactions (such as creating a distribution or claiming rewards) poses a risk of exploitation. The owner could set the fee to a high value just prior to a distribution and revert it afterward, impacting users' ability to claim rewards.

### Root Cause

In the function [setProtocolFee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L246C3-L250C6) , the owner has the capability to change the `protocolFee` at any moment, including right before significant transactions, such as initiating a distribution or processing reward claims.
 - This flexibility poses an exploitation risk, as the owner could temporarily raise the fee to an excessively high level just prior to these transactions. 
 - Once the transactions are complete, the owner could lower the fee back to a normal level. This tactic could hinder users' ability to claim rewards effectively, as they may find themselves facing unexpectedly high fees during critical moments.

### Impact

 This timing manipulation could result in:
- Users being unable to collect their rewards effectively.
- An unfair advantage for the  **owner**  over regular users.


### Mitigation

Implement a **cooldown period or lock mechanism** for fee changes:
-  Implement a cooldown period or lock mechanism for fee changes:
- Introduce a variable that tracks the last time the fee was changed.
- Prevent changes within a specified time frame after a distribution is created.
```solidity
uint256 public lastFeeChangeTimestamp;

function setProtocolFee(uint256 _protocolFee) external onlyOwner {
    require(block.timestamp > lastFeeChangeTimestamp + cooldownPeriod, "Fee change is on cooldown");
    protocolFee = _protocolFee;
    lastFeeChangeTimestamp = block.timestamp;
    emit ProtocolFeeSet(_protocolFee);
}
```
