# lenBytes will revert due to an underflow

### Summary

Currently the `lenBytes` value due to the underflow as prefix of an EIP-1559 transaction is lower than the maximum prefix value for it that is subtracted.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in a fact that the value of maximum prefix for EIP-1559 transaction is subtracted from the prefix.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

The function `decodeTx()` makes an incorrect assumption when it calculates `lenBytes`. This is because it subtracts ` 0xf7` that is a maximum possible value for EIP-1559 transaction prefix from the prefix of an EIP-1559 transaction.

### Impact

The function will revert due to an underflow due to the value of `0x7f` to be bigger than the `prefix`.

### PoC

Take a look at the code implementation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L104
```solidity
 uint8 lenBytes = prefix - 0xf7; // assume lenBytes won't larger than 2, means the tx rlp data size won't exceed 2^16
```

Here the `0x7f` value is subtracted from the `prefix` to determine the tx rlp data size. According to the EIP-2718 specification:

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2718
```solidity
Clients can differentiate between the legacy transactions and typed transactions by looking at the first byte. If it starts with a value in the range [0, 0x7f] then it is a new transaction type, if it starts with a value in the range [0xc0, 0xfe] then it is a legacy transaction type.
```

The EIP-1559 transaction is not a legacy tx meaning its prefix value is within the range of `[0, 0x7f]`. Now according to the EIP-1559 specification:

https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-1559.md
```solidity
We introduce a new [EIP-2718](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-2718.md) transaction type, with the format 0x02 || rlp([chain_id, nonce, max_priority_fee_per_gas, max_fee_per_gas, gas_limit, destination, amount, data, access_list, signature_y_parity, signature_r, signature_s]).

```

As you can see here, the prefix is `0x02` that is much lower than the value subtracted (0x7f). And as the `decodeTx()` function requires for the tx to be of type 2, the prefix will be exactly `0x02`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/brevis/lib/Lib.sol#L82
```solidity
require(txType == 2, "not a DynamicFeeTxType");
```

### Mitigation

Change the logic to extract the `lenBytes` value accordingly without causing an underflow.
