# Incorrect decoding of tightly packed data in `decodeOutput()` function

### Summary

The `decodeOutput()` function is responsible for decoding the raw bytes output from a circuit into component values. The data is expected to be tightly packed.

### Root Cause

The `decodeOutput()` function in the contract contains a critical error in its decoding logic. There is an unexpected 8-byte gap in the decoding process:

<https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L223-L233>

```solidity
function decodeOutput(bytes calldata output) internal pure returns (address, address, uint64, uint64, bytes32, address, uint248, uint248) {
    address userAddress =    address(bytes20(output[0:20]));
    address lpTokenAddress = address(bytes20(output[20:40]));
    uint64 startBlock =        uint64(bytes8(output[48:56]));  // 8-byte gap here
    // ... rest of the function
}
```

This 8-byte gap is inconsistent with tightly packed encoding. In tightly packed encoding, data should be contiguous without any gaps. The presence of this gap indicates that the function is incorrectly decoding the data, misaligning important information.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

None

### Impact

Impact: High.

This decoding error leads to severe misinterpretation of data, causing:

1. Missing 8 bytes of data between `lpTokenAddress` and `startBlock`
2. Misalignment of all subsequent data (startBlock, endBlock, distribution ID, etc.)
3. Potential exploitation if an attacker can manipulate the circuit output to take advantage of this misalignment

These issues could result in incorrect reward distributions, unauthorized access to funds, or other critical failures in the contract's logic.

Likelihood: High.

This issue will affect every decoding operation performed by this function, impacting all interactions that rely on correctly decoded circuit outputs.


### PoC

1. Circuit generates output: `[address1, address2, uint64_1, uint64_2, uint64_3, ...]`
2. `decodeOutput()` function is called with this output
3. Function correctly decodes `address1` and `address2`
4. Function incorrectly skips 8 bytes (uint64_1)
5. Function then decodes uint64_2 as `startBlock`, uint64_3 as `endBlock`, and so on
6. All subsequent values are misaligned, leading to incorrect contract behavior


### Mitigation

1. Shift all values by 8 bytes in the decoding process to correctly align with the tightly packed data:

```solidity
function decodeOutput(bytes calldata output) internal pure returns (address, address, uint64, uint64, bytes32, address, uint248, uint248) {
    address userAddress =    address(bytes20(output[0:20]));
    address lpTokenAddress = address(bytes20(output[20:40]));
    uint64 startBlock =        uint64(bytes8(output[40:48]));  // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    uint64 endBlock =          uint64(bytes8(output[48:56]));  // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    bytes32 distributionId =  bytes32(output[56:88]);          // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    address rewardToken =    address(bytes20(output[88:108])); // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    uint248 amount =          uint248(bytes31(output[108:139])); // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    uint248 fee =             uint248(bytes31(output[139:170])); // Shifted 8 bytes earlier
    // ... rest of the function
    return (userAddress, lpTokenAddress, startBlock, endBlock, distributionId, rewardToken, amount, fee);
}
```

This modification ensures that all data is correctly decoded without missing any information or introducing gaps.
