# Incorrect Hardcoding of MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS Leading to Extended Distribution Periods

### Summary

Incorrect hardcoded MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS value will cause distributions to last 32 weeks instead of the intended 4 weeks as users can create reward distributions that are 8x longer than specified in documentation.


### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder.sol`, the MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is set to a fixed value of 9,676,800 blocks with the intention of representing a 4-week period. However, based on the average block time of 2.0 seconds, this value actually corresponds to roughly 32 weeks.

4 weeks Ã— 604,800 seconds / week = 2,419,200 seconds
Blocks in 4 weeks = 2 seconds / block == 2,419,200 seconds / 2 = 1,209,600 blocks

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User creates distribution with maximum allowed blocks (9,676,800)
2. Block time remains constant at ~2 seconds on Optimism

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls createDistribution() with endBlockNum - startBlockNum = 9,676,800
2. Distribution lasts for 32 weeks instead of intended 4 weeks
3. Rewards are distributed over much longer period than intended

### Impact

 The protocol allows distributions to last 8x longer than intended (32 weeks vs 4 weeks), diluting rewards over a longer period and deviating from documented behavior. This affects reward distribution strategies and token emissions schedules.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS to correct value for 4 weeks:
```solidity
uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600; // 4 weeks with 2s blocks
```
