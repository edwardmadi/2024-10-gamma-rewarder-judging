# Incorrect `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` allows a user to create a 32 weeks long distribution

### Summary

Incorrect `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` allows a user to create a `32` weeks long distribution as Optimism has `43200` blocks per day.

Note : According to Readme, this protocol will be deployed on Optimism
### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45
The value here is `9_676_800`

Optimism has [`43200` blocks per day](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/chart/tx), which means this translates to `32` weeks. This is unintended as there's multiple instances in the code which suggest that the intended value is `4` weeks at max.

### Internal pre-conditions

NA

### External pre-conditions

NA

### Attack Path

1. User creates a distribution for `X` tokens for `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS`, thinking this will be 4 weeks
2. Provers and users have to spend additional resources to claim the reward amount per epoch, and also wait for a much longer period of time to claim all the rewards.
### Impact

Since users will be unaware of this error, the likelihood of creating distributions for `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` thinking that it'll last for 4 weeks is very high.

Due to the consequently larger number of epochs, users will have to claim for a longer period of time and, hence, spend more resources doing so.

Provers would also have to generate a lot more ZK proofs(which has a cost), since claiming will be done every epoch, this will have a much greater cost and require additional resources than if it was just for `4` weeks, for the same amount of reward tokens.

### PoC

NA

### Mitigation

The correct value should be `1209600`
