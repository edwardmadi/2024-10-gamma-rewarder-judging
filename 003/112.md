# MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is calculated wrongly according to Optimism block time

### Summary

In [GammaRewarder::45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45) there is a variable which is set this way:

```solidity
uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks
```

Protocol assumes that 9,676,800 blocks will be mined for 4 weeks, but thats not the case according to Optimsm [docs](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#block-time) where this contract will be deployed.

> L2 block time is 2 seconds, meaning there is an L2 block at every 2s [time slot](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#time-slot). Post-merge, it could be said the that L1 block time is 12s as that is the L1 [time slot](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#time-slot). However, in reality the block time is variable as some time slots might be skipped. Pre-merge, the L1 block time is variable, though it is on average 13s.

With the current implementation:

If 9,676,800 blocks are generated at a rate of 1 block every 2 seconds, then to find the time it will take in weeks, we can calculate as follows:

```js
9,676,800 blocks × 2 seconds per block = 19,353,600 seconds

1 week = 604,800 seconds

19,353,600 seconds / 604,800 seconds = 32 weeks
```

so `9,676,800` blocks will be mined for `32 weeks` in optimsm blockchain. Since there is a big difference this can lead to unintended behavior.

### Mitigation

If we assume that every block is mined in 2 seconds:

```js
1 week = 604,800 seconds

604,800 / 2 = 302,400 blocks per week

302,400 * 4 = 1 209 600 blocks per 4 weeks
```

*(Also MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is constant, consider adding `const` keyword)*
