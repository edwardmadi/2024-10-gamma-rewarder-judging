# Wrong amount of blocks for 4 weeks

### Summary

The constant mentioned in the code [MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45) is wrongly set.

### Root Cause

This protocol is to be launched on optimism blockchain as mentioned in README. The comment in the code mentions the following :

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45

     uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks

which is incorrect number of blocks for 4 weeks in optimism blockchain.
The block time in optimism is 2 seconds. 

    For a 4-week period on Optimism:
    4 weeks = 28 days
    28 days = 28 *24 *60 *60 = 2,419,200 seconds
    With a 2-second block time, the number of blocks in 4 weeks would be:
    2,419,200 / 2 = 1,209,600 blocks

The code incorrectly sets MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS as 4*1,209,600 = 9_676_800 blocks.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Impact

Affects the check in [`CreateDistribution`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L118) function.

    require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");

### Mitigation

Set `uint256 public constant MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600;`
