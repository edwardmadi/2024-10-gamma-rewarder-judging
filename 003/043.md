# Incorrect MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS Setting in GammaRewarder.sol

### Summary

In the GammaRewarder.sol file, the constant MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is intended to represent the number of blocks for a 4-week period, as indicated by the comment 
> // Blocks for 4 weeks. [Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45)

And also indicated by the require statement 
```solidity
require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the **duration is greater than 4 weeks.**"); 
```
So its not wrong comment but wrong value set for MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS  which is 9,676,800
```solidity
uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; 
```
The Optimism network has a block production time of approximately 2 seconds, which means the number of blocks in a 4-week period should be calculated as follows:

(4 weeks ∗ 7 days/week ∗ 24 hours/day ∗ 60 minutes/hour ∗ 60 seconds/minute) / 2 seconds/block = 1,209,600 blocks

This discrepancy results in MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS being set to an incorrect value, nearly 8 times higher than expected.

### Root Cause

_No response_

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This discrepancy could allow for an unintended distribution period significantly exceeding the intended 4-week duration, leading to:

1. Extended Epoch Distribution
2. Protocol Design Deviation

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To align MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS with the intended 4-week period, set MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS to 1,209,600

```diff
- uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800;
+ uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600;

```
