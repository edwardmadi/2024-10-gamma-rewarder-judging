# Distribution can last for more than 4 weeks due to incorrect number of blocks set in MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS

### Summary

The `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is incorrectly configured for Optimism, making it possible to create distributions that last more than 4 weeks.

### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder.sol#L45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45), `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is set to `9_676_800`. However, this value is expected to limit distribution creation to four weeks:

```solidity

function createDistribution(
        address _hypervisor, 
        address _rewardToken, 
        uint256 _amount, 
        uint64 _startBlockNum, 
        uint64 _endBlockNum
    ) external nonReentrant {
        require(_hypervisor != address(0), "Zero address not allowed"); 
        require(_rewardToken != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
        require(_endBlockNum > _startBlockNum, "Invalid block range");
        require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");
       ...

```

From the contest README, the protocol is expected to be deployed on Optimism, where [the block time is of 2 seconds](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#time-slot). So 4 weeks with a 2-second block time should be `1_209_600`  (28 days * 24 hours * 60 minutes * 60 seconds / 2-second block time).

### Internal pre-conditions

None.

### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. User creates a distribution that lasts longer than 4 weeks, by calling `createDistribution` and configuring `_endBlockNum` and `_startBlockNum` so that the difference between them exceeds `9_676_800`.

### Impact

Medium. It is possible to create distributions longer than expected. Although the off-chain mechanisms are out of scope, this could affect proof computations in the claiming of distributions flow, at it is clear from the contracts that distributions should last at most 4 weeks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` so that it is properly configured for optimism:

```diff

contract GammaRewarder is BrevisApp, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable {
    using SafeERC20 for IERC20; 
 
    // =========================== CONSTANTS / VARIABLES ===========================

    /// @notice Base for protocol fee computation
    uint256 public constant BASE_9 = 1e9;
-    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks 
+    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600; // Blocks for 4 weeks 

```
