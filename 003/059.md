# MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is 32 weeks as opposed to 4 weeks

### Summary

In GammaRewarder, the public variation MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is set to 9_676_800, with a code comment implying that the value corresponds to 4 weeks time.

However, since Optimism block times are 2 seconds, in 4 weeks we have 4 * 7 * 86400 = 2419200 seconds and 1_209_600 blocks.

At GammaRewarder::createDistribution, we have the require:

```solidity
require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");
```

which further suggests that no user should be able to create distributions lasting over 4 weeks. However, they can create distributions lasting up to 9_676_800  (32 weeks).

### Root Cause

In [GammaRewarder.sol:45](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45), MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS is set to a value 8x larger than expected.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Someone can call GammaRewarder::createDistribution and create a distribution that lasts longer than 4 weeks.

### Impact

Users can create distributions that last way longer than what the protocol intended, essentially disrupting protocol functionality.

### PoC

Not necessary.

### Mitigation

In GammaRewarder:45, set MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS to 1_209_600 which corresponds to 4 weeks of blocks.
