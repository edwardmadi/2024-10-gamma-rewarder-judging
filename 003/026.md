# Incorrect MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS Value in Solidity Contract

### Summary

The incorrect definition of MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS set to 9,676,800 will cause a significant miscalculation in the expected duration for token distribution for the affected parties. Specifically, it misrepresents the duration of distributions to be only four weeks, while in reality, it corresponds to approximately 224 days under a block time of 2 seconds. This discrepancy could lead to improper management of rewards or incentivization strategies.

### Root Cause

In the GammaRewarder.sol contract, line with the definition of MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS indicates a comment claiming it corresponds to "Blocks for 4 weeks," which is inaccurate given the actual block time for Optimism.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract must be deployed with the assumption that the block time is 2 seconds, which directly affects the expected duration for token distributions.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
If a user or an external actor relies on the faulty assumption that 9,676,800 blocks corresponds to a four-week distribution period, they may plan their participation in the reward program based on this incorrect timeline.

### Impact

Stakeholders could experience prolonged waiting periods for their distributions, leading to potential dissatisfaction or withdrawal from the program. The miscalculation could result in improper financial planning and resource allocation for users expecting faster rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation
Update the MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS variable so its number is equal to roughly how many blocks would be mined on Optimism:
```solidity
uint256 public constant MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600; // Blocks for 2 weeks assuming 2 seconds per block
```
