# Duration of a distribution can exceed 4 weeks

### Summary

an invariant for distribution creation is that it does not exceed 4 weeks and this is ensured using the variable `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS`, which is hardcoded as ` MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800;`. However this value is way more than 4 weeks.


### Root Cause

if the contract is deployed on Optimism as is stated in the `ReadMe`. the amount of blocks produced in 4 weeks will be `2,419,200`.
on Optimism L2, one block is produced every 2 seconds. There are 604,800 seconds in a week making there 2,419,200 in 4 weeks. In 4 weeks 1,209,600 blocks will be produced on Optimism. which is way less than the  9_676_800 in the readme

### Impact

Any use can create a distribution more than 4weeks

### Mitigation
recalculate the value of the `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` based on the Optimism block time.
