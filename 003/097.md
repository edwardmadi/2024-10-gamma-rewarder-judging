# Distributions extexndng beyond 4 weeks can be created due to incorrectly hardcoded `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS`

### Summary

`MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is meant to cover for four weeks, but incorrect. As a result, distributions extending beyond 4 weeks can be created, bypassing one of the major protocol requirements.

### Root Cause

[Here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/475f7fbd0f7c2717ed585a67632e9a675b51c306/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L45), the maximum distribution blocks is set as 9_676_800 blocks. It holds a comment saying its for 4 weeks.

```solidity
    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks
```

Further below, when distributions are created, the function ensures that the difference between the `_endBlockNum` and `_startBlockNum` must not be greater than 4 weeks according to the error string.

```solidity
        require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");
```

`MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` as 9_676_800 is however incorrect as the contracts are to be deployed on Optimism according to the readme.

Optimism has 2 seconds per block according to the [docs](https://docs.optimism.io/connect/resources/glossary#block-time). 

So, 9_676_800 blocks equals 9_676_800 * 2 seconds. 

Converting the result to weeks, we get 9_676_800 * 2 / 604_800 weeks which is 32 weeks. 8 times larger than intended.

### Impact

Distribution blocks can be created for much longer than the protocol desirres, byoassing the restriction out in place.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Use the correct value - 1_209_600.
