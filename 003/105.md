# Incorrect hardcoded `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` parameters will break protocol assumption.

### Summary

The `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is hardcoded to 32 weeks, however it should be 4 weeks.

### Root Cause

In `GammaRewarder.sol:45`, `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is hardcoded to 9_676_800 blocks:
```solidity
    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks
```
Because Gamma Brevis Rewarder is deployed on OP, which block time is 2 seconds, such that `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` represents:
$9676800 blocks = 19353600 s = 32 weeks$

However according to the comments in L45 and L118, it should be 4 weeks not 32 weeks:

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The basic assumption of protocol that the distribution duration should less than 4 weeks is broken.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Set `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` to 1_209_600.
