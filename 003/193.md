# Incorrect `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` Value for Deployment on Optimism

### Summary

The distribution period is intended to be capped at 4 weeks, but `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` is incorrectly set to `9_676_800`, which allows a much longer period. This error enables the incentivizer to create distributions extending well beyond the intended 4-week limit.


### Root Cause

The `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` variable is set incorrectly at `9_676_800`:

```solidity

    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks

```

### Attack Path

1. The distribution duration is intended to be capped at 4 weeks, as indicated by the require statement below:

```solidity

    function createDistribution(
        ***
    ) external nonReentrant {
        require(_hypervisor != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
        require(_rewardToken != address(0), "Zero address not allowed");
        require(_endBlockNum > _startBlockNum, "Invalid block range");
@->     require(_startBlockNum > block.number && (_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum) <= MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS, "Distribution start block number is less than current block number or the duration is greater than 4 weeks.");

```

2. Optimism’s block time is 2 seconds, so the correct value for `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` should be calculated as follows:

> 4 Weeks in Seconds / Optimism's Block Time
> = 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 * 4 / 2
> = 1_209_600

3. Therefore, the value of `MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS` should be `1_209_600`, not `9_676_800`.

### Impact

This misconfiguration allows the incentivizer to set a distribution period up to 8 times longer than the intended 4-week limit.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Apply following mitigation:

```diff

-    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 9_676_800; // Blocks for 4 weeks
+    uint256 public MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS = 1_209_600; // Blocks for 4 weeks

```
