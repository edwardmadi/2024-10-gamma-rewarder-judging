# Removing a Token Causes Rewards to Be Unclaimable

### Summary

The owner can remove a token’s whitelisted status, resulting in the inability to create new distributions for that token or disrupting ongoing distributions.

Impact on incentivizers and users: If a token is removed during an ongoing distribution, users may not be able to claim their rewards, and incentivizers’ tokens could be locked in the contract.
Lack of consideration for existing distributions: The function does not check for ongoing distributions before changing the token’s whitelist status, which can disrupt ongoing processes.
