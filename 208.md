# No emergency withdrawal mechanism is implemented in the contract.

### Summary

The current reward distribution contract lacks an  **emergency withdrawal** mechanism. This could pose risks if the contract encounters unforeseen issues, such as bugs or vulnerabilities, potentially leaving users unable to retrieve their assets.


### Internal pre-conditions

**Scenarios Where It May Not Be Applicable** : 
- No Deposits: If users only receive rewards and do not deposit funds into the contract, the need for an emergency withdrawal mechanism may be less critical.

- External Management: If the contract relies entirely on external sources for funds (e.g., the owner always manages the tokens), then the emergency withdrawal might not be necessary.


### Impact

- User Funds: If users deposit tokens into the contract for reward distribution, the absence of an emergency withdrawal mechanism could prevent them from retrieving their funds if something goes wrong.

- Contract Integrity: If the contract encounters a bug or is compromised, an emergency withdrawal function could allow the owner or users to recover their assets, preserving trust in the contract.

- Reward Tokens: If the contract holds reward tokens that could be stuck due to a contract malfunction or misconfiguration, having a withdrawal mechanism would allow for recovery.

### Mitigation
The following lines of code can be added after event declarations under the following [lines ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L78)
```solidity
event EmergencyWithdrawal(address indexed user, uint256 amount);

function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    // Internal Pre-Conditions
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    require(userBalances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    require(amount > 0, "Withdrawal amount must be greater than zero");
    
    // Withdraw funds logic
    userBalances[msg.sender] -= amount;
    payable(msg.sender).transfer(amount);
    
    // Emit event for the withdrawal
    emit EmergencyWithdrawal(msg.sender, amount);
}
```
