# Funds can be locked indefinitely in the GammaRewarder contract

**Description:**
In the handleProofResult function user can claim their reward shares for indicated by them timeframe(startBlock, endBlock)
With that said an user could decide to withdraw part of their rewards urgently(maybe there is some incentive to do so as to up their collateral ratio somewhere else in order to not be liquidated) while leaving the rest in the contract. Whenever this happens the user could not withdraw anymore as the claimed boolean will be set to true. Or maybe user got blacklisted from USDC and now the rewards can not be transferred to him/her so they stay locked in the contract.

Lets look at this scenario step by step:

Alice(Incentivizor) creates a rewardDistribution for 100 blocks
50 blocks pass
Bob who is a gamma vault user decides to withdraw his rewards for block 0-50 as he needs them urgently
As Bob is still having stake in the gamma pool that means that he will accrue more rewards for Alice's distribution
These rewards will not be claimable by him as he can not claim again by protocol standards
Now there are tokens in the contract that will stay locked indefinitely as there is not a proper withdrawal mechanism
As the example shows this could be the case for lots of more users resulting in large amount of funds being stuck.

**Mitigation:**

Fix is not easy, it requires the protocol to store the funds in an array(erc20 -> amount) whenever there is a partial claim. Withdraw should be for this array only.
