# Incorrect Reward Claim Due to Missing Distribution ID Verification in `handleProofResult`

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187
In the `handleProofResult` function, the reward is distributed to the user without proper verification that the reward corresponds to the correct distribution ID. This opens the possibility for users to claim rewards from other distribution plans by replaying or forging proofs. Without proper validation, users could exploit this vulnerability to drain rewards from distributions that do not belong to them.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L187
The `handleProofResult` function decodes the `appCircuitOutput` to obtain the `distributionId`, but it does not verify whether the reward being claimed matches the `distributionId` from the current distribution plan. As a result, a malicious user could replay a valid proof for another distribution or tamper with the proof to claim rewards from other distribution plans.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The `handleProofResult` function lacks validation to ensure that the `distributionId` in the proof matches the distribution being processed.
- The function does not confirm that the user is eligible to claim the reward for the specific `distributionId`.

### External pre-conditions

An attacker can forge proof of the distribution schedule.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker submits a valid proof from a different `distributionId`.
2. Since the contract does not validate the `distributionId`, the attacker successfully claims the rewards from another distribution plan.
3. The actual intended recipients of the reward are left without their rewards because the rewards have already been claimed.

### Impact

- Users can claim rewards that do not belong to them, draining funds from the contract.
- This could lead to a loss of all rewards in certain distribution plans, preventing legitimate users from receiving their expected rewards.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

- **Add Distribution ID Validation**: Before sending the reward, ensure that the `distributionId` from the decoded proof matches the current distribution plan in the contract.
- **Strict Proof Validation**: Introduce stricter validation checks for proofs to ensure that users can only claim rewards from the specific distribution to which they belong.
