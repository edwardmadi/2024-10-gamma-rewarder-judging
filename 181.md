# Missing Initialization of `protocolFee `in `GammaRewarder` Contract Leading to Incorrect Fee Calculations

### Summary

The `GammaRewarder` contract has a critical issue involving the missing initialization of the `protocolFee` variable. Since `protocolFee` is not assigned a default value, it remains set to 0 by default, which results in incorrect calculations when creating reward distributions. Specifically, any fee calculation involving `protocolFee` will either yield zero or potentially lead to other unintended outcomes, such as transferring zero fees or bypassing expected protocol fee logic. This vulnerability impacts the protocol's revenue collection and can lead to financial loss or incorrect handling of rewards.

### Root Cause

In [`GammaRewarder.sol:59`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L59), the `protocolFee` variable is not initialized, which results in the protocol fee being incorrectly set to 0 by default. This causes any fee calculations to be incorrect, either leading to zero fees being collected or potentially resulting in improper fee distribution logic, thereby impacting the protocolâ€™s intended revenue model and security.
