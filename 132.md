# Permanent Token Lock in GammaRewarder Contract

### Summary

The lack of any  reclaim/recovery function in GammaRewarder.sol will cause a permanent loss of reward tokens for incentivizors as they cannot withdraw unclaimed rewards after the distribution period ends.

### Root Cause

Incentivizors provide reward at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L216

The user are required to claim these rewards within distribution period, which they may not do for a variety of reasons e.g.  missed claims, forgone claims, blacklisted users, etc.
The contract lacks any recovery function for expired distributions for unclaimed rewards


### Internal pre-conditions

1. Incentivizor needs to call createDistribution() to create a distribution.
2. Distribution period needs to end with unclaimed rewards remaining

### External pre-conditions

1. Users need to miss the claiming window of MAX_DISTRIBUTION_BLOCKS

### Attack Path

1. Incentivizor calls createDistribution() with valuable tokens (e.g., USDC)
2. Contract receives and stores reward tokens through safeTransferFrom()
3. Distribution period starts, but users either:

- Miss the claim window
- Lose access to their accounts
- Forget to claim
- Cannot claim e.g. if they are USDC blacklisted
- Do not want to claim as claim is less than expenses like gas fee


4. Distribution period ends
5. Tokens remain locked as there is no reclaim function
6. No mechanism exists to recover the locked tokens

### Impact

The incentivizors suffer permanent loss of all unclaimed rewards from their distributions. The contract itself gains these tokens but they become effectively unusable.
