# Protocol will lose out on tiny bits of fees due to rounding issues

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-10-gamma-rewarder/blob/main/GammaRewarder/contracts/GammaRewarder.sol#L125

The logic used in fee calculation allows fees to be rounded down, this would lead to the protocol receiving less in fees, especially for lower decimal tokens like usdc(6) where it is easier for this loss to compound over time and become significant 

### Root Cause

Solidity rounds down division by default 

### Internal pre-conditions

### Impact

Protocol would lose small amounts in fees 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Fees should be rounded up, perhaps using a library like oz math library ceilDiv
