# Protocol does not support DynamicFeeTxType Transactions

### Summary

In EIP-1559 transactions, there is an access list (introduced in EIP-2930), which is not being considered here. The access list comes before the signature in the RLP-encoded transaction, so the decoding should account for it. This oversight might cause incorrect parsing of v, r, and s if an access list is present.

### Root Cause

In Lib.sol:80 the function `decodeTx` should only support `DynamicFeeTxType` transactions. However, that is not the case. The DTO/Payload returned by such a transaction should be:

```md
@dataclass
class Transaction1559Payload:
    chain_id: int = 0
    signer_nonce: int = 0
    max_priority_fee_per_gas: int = 0
    max_fee_per_gas: int = 0
    gas_limit: int = 0
    destination: int = 0
    amount: int = 0
    payload: bytes = bytes()
    access_list: List[Tuple[int, List[int]]] = field(default_factory=list)
    signature_y_parity: bool = False
    signature_r: int = 0
    signature_s: int = 0
 ```   

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `DynamicFeeTxType` is used (EIP 1559)

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol will have issues decoding transactions which can lead to wrong or stale data.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Rework the `decodeTx` function to rightfully consider the access list passed by the transaction's payload.
