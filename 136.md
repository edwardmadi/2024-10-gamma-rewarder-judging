# protocol will prevent users from claiming their rewards of the same token from different epochs of the same distribution

### Summary

Bad state variable choice `mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => CumulativeClaim))) public claimed;` together with poor check `require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");` will cause funds to be stuck in the `GammaRewarder` contract forever preventing user from claiming their worthy rewards.

### Root Cause

There's a _dev assumption_  that users are only going to claim their rewards once for each distribution. This assumption was identified through this state variable:
`mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => CumulativeClaim))) public claimed;`
The choice to use this state variable to store claims is a mistake as a certain user A who claims a certain token B reward during a certain distribution C in a certain claim period D cannot claim rewards for the same token B during the same distribution C in a certain claim period E that does not overlap D and that is mainly do to their way of _Closing reentrancy gate_ here:
`CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];`
`require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");`
After the first claim, `claim.amount` will be `!= 0` and `require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");` will always revert on a 2nd claim attempt for another claim period.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `incentivizor` creates a distribution
2. `_endBlockNum - _startBlockNum >=  2 * blocksPerEpoch`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A claims his rewards in token B during the distribution C, epoch 0
2. User A tries to claim his rewards in token B during the distribution C, epoch 1 and fails because of a revert here:
`require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");`

### Impact

If the scenario described above would repeat for every user, they will miss significant rewards that will be forever stuck in the `GammaRewarder` contract, even more so if there are multiple epochs. The impact of this issue is high and the likelihood of it happening is quite significant too.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the following changes:
```diff
- mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => CumulativeClaim))) public claimed;
+ mapping(address => mapping(address => mapping(bytes32 => CumulativeClaim[]))) public claimed;
```
```diff
-CumulativeClaim memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
-require(claim.amount == 0 , "Already claimed reward.");
-claim.startBlock = startBlock;
-claim.endBlock = endBlock;
-claim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
+CumulativeClaim[] memory claim = claimed[userAddress][rewardTokenAddress][distributionId];
+CumulativeClaim memory newClaim;
+newClaim.startBlock = startBlock;
+newClaim.endBlock = endBlock;
+newClaim.amount = totalRewardAmount;
+uint256 len = claim.length();
+for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
+    if (claim[i].endBlock >= newClaim.startBlock)
+        revert("claim periods cannot overlap");
+}
+claim.push(newClaim);
```
